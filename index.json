Most studies on the topic take place within eastern boundary systems, where the intensity and frequency of upwelling are high. Here, we test the generality of the IUH towards the other end of the upwelling spectrum, within two regions located at similar latitudes along western boundary currents of two continents. We measured barnacle recruitment and colonisation, which we expected to be linked positively to productivity, across eight rocky shores along the east coasts of South Africa and Australia selected to capture a range of upwelling regimes. Based on Bakun Upwelling Indices (BUI), the four South African sites experienced persistent to intermittent levels of upwelling, whilst the four sites along the east coast of Australia were predominantly downwelling sites with occasional upwelling events. Satellite chlorophyll a concentrations ([Chl-a]) also showed a marked difference between the two continents, with 2–3 times higher concentrations in South Africa than Australia. In situ sea temperature measurements revealed slightly different oceanographic patterns, which were nonetheless compatible with both BUI and [Chl-a] measurements. Barnacle recruitment was typically greater within South Africa and but was generally found to vary unimodally with mean BUI (i.e. being greater at sites that experienced moderate upwelling conditions) and to increase linearly with increasing upwelling frequency between January and April when barnacle larvae are known to be most abundant in the water column. Viewed in isolation, our data provide moderate support for the IUH. But when placed in a broader context, with our eight study locations representing just one end of the upwelling continuum, they provide strong evidence for the IUH.","tags":null,"title":"Testing the intermittent upwelling hypothesis: Intercontinental comparisons of barnacle recruitment between South Africa and Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D.

Time series observations of seabirds away from breeding colonies are generally rare, which limits our understanding of long-term changes for conservation actions. We analysed a dedicated citizen science dataset of pelagic seabird abundance (86 species – 30 used for modelling analysis - from 385 trips) from two locations over 17 years (2000–2016) and a third for seven years, over the continental shelf and slope of south-eastern Australia. To estimate temporal trends and environmental drivers, we used generalised additive modelling and species archetype modelling for groups. Almost half (43%) of the most abundant seabird species declined in our study area over the 17 years. The declines may be associated with human-induced ecosystem change and represent poleward shifts in distribution out of our study area, changes in population abundance, or both. Winter-dominant groups, primarily species rarely frequenting warmer water, were often negatively associated with SSTanom, while summer-dominant groups, composed of species more tolerant of temperate and tropical environments, were generally positively associated with SSTanom. Widespread local declines in seabird populations are of increasing concern. Understanding the extent to which these observed declines represent real declines in abundance, or range shifts, should be a priority. Changing sea temperatures are probably contributing to both. These results from the coast of south-eastern Australia need to be placed in the context of the highly mobile study organisms and the vast spatial scale of the ocean. Long-term citizen science observations, from an array of locations around the world, promise to provide valuable insights into seabird ecology, playing a key part in seabird conservation.","tags":null,"title":"Pelagic citizen science data reveal declines of seabirds off south-eastern Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hayden T Schilling","James A Smith","John Stewart","Jason D Everett","Julian M Hughes","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560855259,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560855259,"objectID":"030e29bf2f687bf46b9d3ae1c2983f65","permalink":"/publication/schilling-2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.352405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schilling-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Pomatomus saltatrix is an important recreational fishing species with seven major populations worldwide.

We also report a second, previously undescribed, late-summer spawning event which was identified by analysing patterns in a gonadosomatic index across the whole population and an historical larval fish database. P. saltatrix are capable of spawning multiple times per season with estimates of batch fecundity ranging from 99,488 to 1,424,425 eggs per fish. When combined with the length frequency distribution of the population, the majority of eggs (64%) were shown to be produced by fish ≤40 cm fork length (FL). L50 was estimated at 30.2 and 31.5 cm FL for male and female P. saltatrix respectively, 4 cm larger than 40 years ago. The sex ratio of the population was found to have significantly shifted over the last 40 years from an equal sex ratio to a female dominated population (1.58 females:1 male). These dramatic alterations to the sex ratio and L50 highlights the value of monitoring the reproductive biology of exploited fish populations to ensure that management plans remain appropriate.","tags":null,"title":"Reduced exploitation is associated with an altered sex ratio and larger length at maturity in southwest Pacific (east Australian) Pomatomus saltatrix","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natasha Henschke","Evgeny A Pakhomov","Lian E Kwong","Jason D Everett","Leonardo Laiolo","Amy R Coghlan","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"cab9a33d7890bd7ca445fac4e65bb1ee","permalink":"/publication/henschke-2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.369754Z","relpermalink":"/publication/henschke-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Pyrosomes are efficient grazers that can form dense aggregations.

During the austral spring of 2017 a Pyrosoma atlanticum swarm was sampled in the Tasman Sea. Depth‐stratified sampling during the day and night was used to examine the spatial and vertical distribution of P. atlanticum across three eddies. Respiration rate experiments were performed onboard to determine minimum feeding requirements for the pyrosome population. P. atlanticum was 2 orders of magnitude more abundant in the cold core eddy (CCE) compared to both warm core eddies, with maximum biomass of 360 mg WW·m−3, most likely driven by high chlorophyll a concentrations. P. atlanticum exhibited diel vertical migration and migrated to a maximum depth strata of 800–1,000 m. Active carbon transport in the CCE was 4 orders of magnitude higher than the warm core eddies. Fecal pellet production contributed to the majority (91%) of transport, and total downward carbon flux below the mixed layer was estimated at 11 mg C·m−2·d−1.

We used otolith chemistry to evaluate the use of estuaries and the coastal marine environment by juvenile Pomatomus saltatrix in eastern Australia. Otolith chemical signatures of juveniles from 12 estuaries, spanning 10° of latitude, were characterised using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Based upon multivariate otolith elemental signatures, fish collected from most estuaries could not be successfully discriminated from one another. This was attributed to the varying influence of marine water on otolith elemental composition in fish from all estuaries. Using a reduced number of estuarine groups, the multivariate juvenile otolith elemental signatures and univariate Sr:Ca ratio suggest that between 24 and 52% of adult P. saltatrix had a juvenile period influenced by the marine environment. Elemental profiles across adult (age-1) otoliths highlighted a variety of life history patterns, not all consistent with a juvenile estuarine phase. Furthermore, the presence of age-0 juveniles in coastal waters was confirmed from historical length-frequency data from coastal trawls. Combining multiple lines of evidence suggests considerable plasticity in juvenile life history for P. saltatrix in eastern Australia through their utilisation of both estuarine and coastal nurseries.

Particles were exposed to a constant natural mortality rate, and temperature‐dependent growth (degree‐days) was used to determine the time of settlement. Forward and backward simulations were used to identify the extent of larval dispersal from key source locations, and to determine the putative spawning regions for four settlement sites. The mean dispersal distance for larvae was extensive (750-1,000 km before settlement), yet the northern spawning locations were unlikely to contribute larvae to the most southern extent of the EKP range. There was generally great offshore dispersal of larvae, with only 2%–5% of larvae on the continental shelf at the time of settlement. Our particle tracking results were combined with existing site‐specific reproductive potentials to identify the relative contributions of larvae from key source locations. Although mid‐latitude sites had only moderate reproductive potential, they delivered the most particles to the southern coast and are probably the most important sources of larval EKP for the two southern estuaries.

The magnitude of surface NPP (0.20–19.3 mmol C m−3 d−1) across sites was largely driven by phytoplankton biomass, with higher rates being attributed to the microplankton (20 μm) size class. The phytoplankton absorption coefficient aPHY for PAR (photosynthetically active radiation; āPHY)) ranged from 0.003 to 0.073 m-1, influenced by changes in phytoplankton community composition, physiology and environmental conditions. The aPHY coefficient also reflected changes in NPP and the absorption model-derived NPP could explain 73% of the variability in measured surface NPP (n = 41; RMSE = 2.49). The absorption model was applied to two contrasting coastal locations to examine NPP dynamics: a high chlorophyll-high variation (HCHV; Port Hacking National Reference Station) and moderate chlorophyll-low variation (MCLV; Yongala National Reference Station) location in eastern Australia using the GIOP-DC satellite aPHY product. Mean daily NPP rates between 2003 and 2015 were higher at the HCHV site (1.71 ± 0.03 mmol C m−3 d−1) with the annual maximum NPP occurring during the austral winter.

The establishment of a national system that could facilitate the development of such model-based assessments has been identified as a priority for addressing management challenges for Australia’s marine environment.

The less detailed latitudinal summary was created to limit the resolution of habitat information to prevent potential resource over-exploitation by fishers in the absence of total catch controls. The forecast dolphinfish habitat model was accurate at the start of the annual dolphinfish migration in NSW (December) but other months (January - May) showed poor performance due to spatial and temporal variability in the catch data used in model validation. Habitat forecasts for December were useful up to five months ahead, with performance decreasing as forecast were made further into the future.

We describe how this can be overcome by unifying functional traits with size spectra (which we call functional size spectra) and highlight the key knowledge gaps that need to be filled to model ecosystems from bacteria to whales.","tags":null,"title":"From Bacteria to Whales: Using Functional Size Spectra to Model Marine Ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D Everett","Mark E Baird","Pearse Buchanan","Cathy Bulman","Claire Davies","Ryan Downie","Chris Griffiths","Ryan Heneghan","Rudy J Kloser","Leonardo Laiolo","Ana Lara-Lopez","Hector Lozano-Montes","Richard J Matear","Felicity McEnnulty","Barbara Robson","Wayne Rochester","Jenny Skerratt","James A Smith","Joanna Strzelecki","Iain M Suthers","Kerrie M Swadling","Paul van Ruth","Anthony J Richardson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"0615cc93a33bd807d2e48c20f6eefb0d","permalink":"/publication/everett-2017-dg/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.353521Z","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2017-dg/","section":"publication","summary":"Zooplankton are the intermediate trophic level between phytoplankton and fish, and are an important component of carbon and nutrient cycles, accounting for a large proportion of the energy transfer to pelagic fishes and the deep ocean. Given zooplankton's importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by filling three gaps. The first is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical, ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton. The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations provides the necessary context to address the last gap—a blueprint for model assessment of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling What We Sample and Sampling What We Model: Challenges for Zooplankton Model Assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan F Heneghan","Jason D Everett","Julia L Blanchard","Anthony J Richardson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"7b69b241000425afa07a4999b49bfe37","permalink":"/publication/heneghan-2016-jg/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.36592Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heneghan-2016-jg/","section":"publication","summary":"The evidence for an equal distribution of biomass from bacteria to whales has led to development of size-spectrum models that represent the dynamics of the marine ecosystem using size rather than species identity. Recent advances have improved the realism of the fish component of the size-spectrum, but these often assume that small fish feed on an aggregated plankton size-spectrum, without any explicit representation of zooplankton dynamics. In these models, small zooplankton are grouped with phytoplankton as a resource for larval fish, and large zooplankton are parameterized as small fish. Here, we investigate the impact of resolving zooplankton and their feeding traits in a dynamic size-spectrum model. First, we compare a base model, where zooplankton are parameterized as smaller fish, to a model that includes zooplankton-specific feeding parameters. Second, we evaluate how the parameterization of zooplankton feeding characteristics, specifically the predator–prey mass ratio (PPMR), assimilation efficiency and feeding kernel width, affects the productivity and stability of the fish community. Finally, we compare how feeding characteristics of different zooplankton functional groups mediate increases in primary production and fishing pressure. Incorporating zooplankton-specific feeding parameters increased productivity of the fish community, but also changed the dynamics of the entire system from a stable to an oscillating steady-state. The inclusion of zooplankton feeding characteristics mediated a trade-off between the productivity and resilience of the fish community, and its stability. Fish communities with increased productivity and lower stability were supported by zooplankton with a larger PPMR and a narrower feeding kernel–specialized herbivores. In contrast, fish communities that were stable had lower productivity, and were supported by zooplankton with a lower PPMR and a wider feeding kernel—generalist carnivores. Herbivorous zooplankton communities were more efficient at mediating increases in primary production, and supported fish communities more resilient to fishing. Our results illustrate that zooplankton are not just a static food source for larger organisms, nor can they be resolved as very small fish. The unique feeding characteristics of zooplankton have enormous implications for the dynamics of marine ecosystems, and their representation is of critical importance in size-spectrum models, and end-to-end ecosystem models more broadly.","tags":null,"title":"Zooplankton Are Not Fish: Improving Zooplankton Realism in Size-Spectrum Models Mediates Energy Transfer in Food Webs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natasha Henschke","Jason D Everett","Anthony J Richardson","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563854503,"objectID":"6a0da9db49b087ed65a6ab9f645bce2c","permalink":"/publication/henschke-2016-ed/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.366769Z","relpermalink":"/publication/henschke-2016-ed/","section":"publication","summary":"Salps are barrel-shaped, gelatinous zooplankton that regularly form large swarms.

This seabird feeds on low trophic level species that are sensitive to environmental change. We found that in 2012, prey capture success by penguins was high when SST was low relative to the long-term mean. In 2013 prey capture success was low, coincident with an unusually strong penetration of warm water. Overall there was an optimal temperature range for prey capture around 19–21 °C, with lower success at both lower and higher temperatures, mirroring published relationships between commercial sardine catch and SST. Spatially, higher SSTs corresponded to a lower probability of penguins using an area, and lower prey capture success.

To understand eddy-induced changes in microbial community composition as well as how they control growth, we targeted the East Australian Current (EAC) region to sample microbes in a cyclonic (cold-core) eddy (CCE) and the adjacent EAC. Phototrophic and diazotrophic microbes were more diverse (2–10 times greater Shannon index) in the CCE relative to the EAC, and the cell size distribution in the CCE was dominated (67%) by larger micro-plankton (≥20μm), as opposed to pico- and nano-sized cells in the EAC. Nutrient addition experiments determined that nitrogen was the principal nutrient limiting growth in the EAC, while iron was a secondary limiting nutrient in the CCE. Among the diazotrophic community, heterotrophic NifH gene sequences dominated in the EAC and were attributable to members of the gamma-, beta-, and delta-proteobacteria, while the CCE contained both phototrophic and heterotrophic diazotrophs, including Trichodesmium, UCYN-A and gamma-proteobacteria. Daily sampling of incubation bottles following nutrient amendment captured a cascade of effects at the cellular, population and community level, indicating taxon-specific differences in the speed of response of microbes to nutrient supply. Nitrogen addition to the CCE community increased picoeukaryote chlorophyll a quotas within 24 h, suggesting that nutrient uplift by eddies causes a ‘greening’ effect as well as an increase in phytoplankton biomass. After three days in both the EAC and CCE, diatoms increased in abundance with macronutrient (N, P, Si) and iron amendment, whereas haptophytes and phototrophic dinoflagellates declined. Our results indicate that cyclonic eddies increase delivery of nitrogen to the upper ocean to potentially mitigate the negative consequences of increased stratification due to ocean warming, but also increase the biological demand for iron that is necessary to sustain the growth of large-celled phototrophs and potentially support the diversity of diazotrophs over longer time-scales.","tags":null,"title":"Nutrient uplift in a cyclonic eddy increases diversity, primary productivity and iron demand of microbial communities relative to a western boundary current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephanie Brodie","Alistair J Hobday","James A Smith","Jason D Everett","Matt D Taylor","Charles A Gray","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"ba752da17746b8d667d1c3de9363b0e7","permalink":"/publication/brodie-2015-a/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.35654Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brodie-2015-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Defining the oceanic habitats of migratory marine species is important for both single species and ecosystem‐based fisheries management, particularly when the distribution of these habitats vary temporally.

A Poisson point process model within a generalized additive modelling framework was used to determine the species distributions off the east coast of Australia as a function of several oceanographic covariates. This modelling framework uses presence‐only data to determine the intensity of fish (fish km−2), rather than a probability of fish presence. Sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomaly, SST frontal index and eddy kinetic energy were significant environmental predictors for both dolphinfish and kingfish distributions. Models for both species indicate a greater fish intensity off the east Australian coast during summer and autumn in response to the regional oceanography, namely shelf incursions by the East Australian Current.

Thousands of estimates of marine PP exist globally, but there remain significant gaps in data availability, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. In situ PP estimates are generally single-point measurements and therefore we rely on satellite models of PP in order to scale up over time and space. To reduce the uncertainty around the model output, these models need to be assessed against in situ measurements before use. This study examined the vertically-integrated productivity in four water-masses associated with the East Australian Current (EAC), the major western boundary current (WBC) of the South Pacific. We calculated vertically integrated PP from shipboard 14C PP estimates and then compared them to estimates from four commonly used satellite models (ESQRT, VGPM, VGPM-Eppley, VGPM-Kameda) to assess their utility for this region. Vertical profiles of the water-column show each water-mass had distinct temperature–salinity signatures. The depth of the fluorescence-maximum (fmax) increased from onshore (river plume) to offshore (EAC) as light penetration increased. Depth integrated PP was highest in river plumes (792±181 mg C m−2 d−1) followed by the EAC (534±116 mg C m−2 d−1), continental shelf (140±47 mg C m−2 d−1) and cyclonic eddy waters (121±4 mg C m−2 d−1). Surface carbon assimilation efficiency was greatest in the EAC (301±145 mg C (mg Chl-a)−1 d−1) compared to other water masses. All satellite primary production models tested underestimated EAC PP and overestimated continental shelf PP. The ESQRT model had the highest skill and lowest bias of the tested models, providing the best first-order estimates of PP on the continental shelf, including at a coastal time-series station, Port Hacking, which showed considerable inter-annual variability (155–2957 mg C m−2 d−1). This work provides the first estimates of depth integrated PP associated with the East Australian Current in temperate Australia. The ongoing intensification of all WBCs makes it critical to understand the variability in PP at the regional scale. More accurate predictions in the EAC region will require vertically-resolved in situ productivity and bio-optical measurements across multiple time scales to allow development of other models which simulate dynamic ocean conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Characterising primary productivity measurements across a dynamic western boundary current region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D Everett","Helen Macdonald","Mark E Baird","Joshua Humphries","Moninya Roughan","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"11cd3c10a82319e07c2f0580f66537c3","permalink":"/publication/everett-2015-a/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.355483Z","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2015-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The volume transport of nutrient‐rich continental shelf water into a cyclonic frontal eddy (entrainment) was examined from satellite observations, a Slocum glider and numerical simulation outputs.

The distribution of patches of shelf water observed within the eddy was consistent with the spiral pattern shown within the numerical simulations. A numerical dye tracer experiment showed that the surface waters (≤50 m depth) of the frontal eddy are almost entirely (≥95%) shelf waters.

Consistent with the glider observations, the modeled particles entrained into the eddy sunk relative to their initial position. Particles released south of 33°S, where the waters are cooler and denser, sunk 34 m deeper than their release position. Distance to the shelf was a critical factor in determining the volume of shelf water entrained into the eddy. Entrainment reduced to 0.23 Sv when the eddy was furthest from the shelf, compared to 0.61 Sv when the eddy was within 10 km of the shelf.

The WCE was an oligotrophic environment and was associated with an increased trophic level for omnivorous zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids) to a similar level as carnivorous zooplankton (chaetognaths).

Our analysis revealed regions of persistently elevated surface Chl. a along the continental shelf and showed that different processes have a dominant effect in different locations.

The interaction of wind and the EAC was a critical driver of surface Chl. a dynamics, with upwelling-favourable $τ$W resulting in a 70% increase in surface Chl. a at some locations, when compared to downwelling-favourable $τ$W. In the southern zone, surface Chl. a was driven by a strong seasonal cycle, with phytoplankton biomass increasing up to 152% annually each spring. The Stockton Bight region (32.25–33.25°S) contained ⩾20% of the total shelf Chl. a on 27% of occasions due to its location downstream of upwelling locations, wide shelf area and reduced surface velocities. This region is analogous to productive fisheries regions in the Aghulus Current (Natal Bight) and Kuroshio Current (Enshu-nada Sea). These patterns of phytoplankton biomass show contrasting temporal dynamics north and south of the central EAC separation zone with more episodic upwelling-driven Chl. a anomalies to the north, compared with regular annual spring bloom dynamics to the south. We expect changes in the strength of the EAC to have greater influence on shelf phytoplankton dynamics to the north of the separation zone.","tags":null,"title":"Relative impact of seasonal and oceanographic drivers on surface chlorophyll a along a Western Boundary Current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martina A Doblin","Christel S Hassler","J R Seymour","Mark E Baird","Jason D Everett","M V Brown","Katherina L Petrou","Peter J Ralph","Peter A Thompson","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"b015b85a0fe71913a177c78d16505bfd","permalink":"/publication/doblin-2014/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.36228Z","relpermalink":"/publication/doblin-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Shift in photosynthetic microbial assemblages and coastal biogeochemical functioning due to a strengthening western boundary current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Henschke","D A Bowden","Jason D Everett","S P Holmes","R J Kloser","R W Lee","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"063c3510a748caf5b0375eef5686dbed","permalink":"/publication/henschke-2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.354581Z","relpermalink":"/publication/henschke-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Large, fast-sinking carcasses (food-falls) are an important source of nutrition to deep-sea benthic communities. In 2007 and 2009, mass depositions of the salp Thetys vagina were observed on the Tasman Sea floor between 200 and 2500 m depth, where benthic crustaceans were observed feeding on them. Analysis of a long-term (1981 to 2011) trawl survey database determined that salp biomass (wet weight, WW) in the eastern Tasman Sea regularly exceeds 100 t km-3 yr-1, with biomasses as high as 734 t km-3 recorded in a single trawl. With fast sinking rates, salp fluxes to the seafloor occur year-round. Salps, like jellyfish, have been considered to be of low nutritional value; however, biochemical analyses revealed that T. vagina has a carbon (31% dry weight, DW) and energy (11.00 kJ g-1 DW) content more similar to that of phytoplankton blooms, copepods and fish than to that of jellyfish, with which they are often grouped. The deposition of the mean yearly biomass (4.81 t km-2 WW) of salps recorded from the trawl database in the Tasman Sea represents a 330% increase to the carbon input normally estimated for this region. Given their abundance, rapid export to the seabed and high nutritional value, salp carcasses are likely to be a significant input of carbon to benthic food webs, which, until now, has been largely overlooked.","tags":null,"title":"Salp-falls in the Tasman Sea: a major food input to deep-sea benthos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D Everett","Mark E Baird","Peter R Oke","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"9ca2b2ff18c284fdcd48690753928a49","permalink":"/publication/everett-2012/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.372475Z","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2012/","section":"publication","summary":" The Tasman Sea is unique ‐ characterised by a strong seasonal western boundary current that breaks down into a complicated field of mesoscale eddies almost immediately after separating from the coast. Through a 16‐year analysis of Tasman Sea eddies, we identify a region along the southeast Australian coast which we name ‘Eddy Avenue’ where eddies have higher sea level anomalies, faster rotation and greater sea surface temperature and chlorophylla anomalies. The density of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies within Eddy Avenue is 23% and 16% higher respectively than the broader Tasman Sea. We find that Eddy Avenue cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies have more strongly differentiated biological properties than those of the broader Tasman Sea, as a result of larger anticyclonic eddies formed from Coral Sea water depressing chl. aconcentrations, and for coastal cyclonic eddies due to the entrainment of nutrient‐rich shelf waters. Cyclonic eddies within Eddy Avenue have almost double the chlorophylla (0.35 mg m−3) of anticyclonic eddies (0.18 mg m−3). The average chlorophyll a concentration for cyclonic eddies is 16% higher in Eddy Avenue and 28% lower for anticyclonic eddies when compared to the Tasman Sea. With a strengthening East Australian Current, the propagation of these eddies will have significant implications for heat transport and the entrainment and connectivity of plankton and larval fish populations.","tags":null,"title":"An avenue of eddies: Quantifying the biophysical properties of mesoscale eddies in the Tasman Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D Everett","Mark E Baird","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1322697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"a544627d9931ef44aa613e94e3504338","permalink":"/publication/everett-2011/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.36868Z","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Swarms of the salp Thalia democratica periodically occur off southeast Australia following the austral spring bloom of phytoplankton.

In this paper, Warreen observations along the southeast Australian seaboard from 28°S to 38°S are interpreted based on synoptic meteorological and oceanographic conditions and ocean climatologies. Meteorological conditions are based on the NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis Project; oceanographic conditions use Warreen hydrological observations, and the ocean climatology is the CSIRO Atlas of Regional Seas. The Warreen observations were undertaken in waters on average 0.45 °C cooler than the climatological average, and included the longest duration El Niño of the 20th century. In northern New South Wales (NSW), week time-scale events dominate zooplankton response. In August 1940 an unusual winter upwelling event occurred in northern NSW driven by a stronger than average East Australian Current (EAC) and anomalous northerly winds that resulted in high salp and larvacean abundance. In January 1941 a strong upwelling event between 28° and 33°S resulted in a filament of upwelled water being advected south and alongshore, which was low in zooplankton biovolume. In southern NSW a seasonal cycle in physical and planktonic characteristics is observed. In January 1941 the poleward extension of the EAC was strong, advecting more tropical tunicate species southward. Zooplankton abundance and distribution on the continental shelf and slope are more dependent on weekly to monthly timescales on local oceanographic and meteorological conditions than continental-scale interannual trends. The interpretation of historical zooplankton observations of the waters off southeast Australia for the purpose of quantifying anthropogenic impacts will be improved with the use of regional hindcasts of synoptic ocean and atmospheric weather that can explain some of the physically forced natural variability.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of southeast Australian zooplankton observations of 1938–42 using synoptic oceanographic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christel S Hassler","Peter A Thompson","J R Djajadikarta","Martina A Doblin","Jason D Everett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1298937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"d1258047aaab5abfcc7a7ccb2f642202","permalink":"/publication/hassler-2011/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.360105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hassler-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"This study focuses on the comparison of oceanic and coastal cold-core eddies with inner-shelf and East Australian Current (EAC) waters at the time of the spring bloom (October 2008). The surface water was biologically characterised by the phytoplankton biomass, composition, photo-physiology, carbon fixation and by nutrient-enrichment experiments. Marked differences in phytoplankton biomass and composition were observed. Contrasted biomarker composition suggests that biomarkers could be used to track water masses in this area. Divinyl chlorophyll a, a biomarker for tropical Prochlorophytes, was found only in the EAC. Zeaxanthin a biomarker for Cyanophytes, was found only within the oceanic eddy and in the EAC, whereas chlorophyll b (Chlorophytes) was only present in the coastal eddy and at the front between the inner-shelf and EAC waters. This study showed that cold-core eddies can affect phytoplankton, biomass, biodiversity and productivity. Inside the oceanic eddy, greater phytoplankton biomass and a more complex phytoplankton community were observed relative to adjacent water masses (including the EAC). In fact, phytoplankton communities inside the oceanic eddy more closely resembled the community observed in the inner-shelf waters. At a light level close to half-saturation, phytoplankton carbon fixation (gC d−1) in the oceanic eddy was 13-times greater than at the frontal zone between the eddy and the EAC and 3-times greater than in the inner-shelf water. Nutrient-enrichment experiments demonstrated that nitrogen was the major macronutrient limiting phytoplankton growth in water masses associated with the oceanic eddy. Although the effective quantum yield values demonstrate healthy phytoplankton communities, the phytoplankton community bloomed and shifted in response to nitrogen enrichments inside the oceanic eddy and in the frontal zone between this eddy and the EAC. An effect of Si enrichment was only observed at the frontal zone between the eddy and the EAC. No response to nutrient enrichment was observed in the inner-shelf water where ambient NOx, Si and PO4 concentrations were up to 14, 4 and 3-times greater than in the EAC and oceanic eddy. Although results from the nutrient-enrichment experiments suggest that nutrients can affect biomass and the composition of the phytoplankton community, the comparison of all sites sampled showed no direct relationship between phytoplankton biomass, nutrients and the depth of the mixed layer. This is probably due to the different timeframe between the rapidly changing physical and chemical oceanography in the separation zone of the EAC.","tags":null,"title":"Characterisation of water masses and phytoplankton nutrient limitation in the East Australian Current separation zone during spring 2008","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark E Baird","Iain M Suthers","David A Griffin","Ben Hollings","Charitha Pattiaratchi","Jason D Everett","Moninya Roughan","Martina A Doblin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"ba8a6425a7488dff07da4b918fe09fbf","permalink":"/publication/baird-2011-b/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.380534Z","relpermalink":"/publication/baird-2011-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Warm-core eddies (WCEs) formed from the East Australian Current (EAC) play an important role in the heat, mass and biogeochemical budgets of the western Tasman Sea. The development and separation of an EAC WCE during July–December 2008 was observed using remotely sensed temperature, ocean colour and sea-level elevation, three Argo floats, a shipboard CTD, a shelf mooring array and a 15-day deployment of a Slocum glider. The eddy formed from an EAC meander during the first half of 2008 and in late August had a deep surface mixed layer. In the two months before separation in early December, fresher and warmer EAC water flooded the top of the eddy, submerging the winter mixed layer. The rate of vertical transport due to submergence was estimated to be between 1 and 6 Sv, at the time accounting for a significant fraction of the mean southward flow of the EAC. The core of the eddy had a surface chlorophyll a concentration of throughout the observations. A 20–40 m thick pycnocline formed at the interface of the flooding surface waters and the submerged layer. Chlorophyll a concentration in the pycnocline ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg m−3, with depth-integrated concentration ranging between 25 and 75 mg m−2. The development of a sub-surface maximum suggests that flooding increased light levels in the pycnocline. Elevated levels of coloured dissolved organic matter in the submerged layer correspond to oxygen depletion, suggesting respiration of organic matter. A comparison is made with observations from WCEs in 1978 and 1997 in which, unusually, surface flooding did not occur, but solar heating stratified the top 50 m. In the two eddies with surface capping, surface chlorophyll a concentrations were an order of magnitude higher than the 2008 flooded eddy, but depth-integrated chlorophyll a was similar. These findings suggest that EAC WCEs with relatively shallow surface flooding contain more phytoplankton biomass than surface images would suggest, with the vertical position of the chlorophyll a maximum depending on whether, and to what depth, the winter surface mixed layer is submerged.","tags":null,"title":"The effect of surface flooding on the physical–biogeochemical dynamics of a warm-core eddy off southeast Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iain M Suthers","Jock W Young","Mark E Baird","Moninya Roughan","Jason D Everett","Gary B Brassington","Maria Byrne","Scott A Condie","Jason R Hartog","Christel S Hassler","Alistair J Hobday","Neil J Holbrook","Hamish A Malcolm","Peter A Thompson","Ken R Ridgway"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563949346,"objectID":"1e23741aa2961ade5d24333a293b0c58","permalink":"/publication/suthers-2011/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.379734Z","relpermalink":"/publication/suthers-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The poleward flowing East Australian Current (EAC) is characterised by its separation from the coast, 100–200 nautical miles north of Sydney, to form the eastward flowing Tasman Front and a southward flowing eddy field. The separation zone greatly influences coastal ecosystems for the relatively narrow continental shelf (only 15–50 km wide), particularly between 32–34°S. In this region the continental shelf has a marked shift in the seasonal temperature-salinity relationship and elevated surface nitrate concentrations. This current parallels the portion of the coast where Australia’s population is concentrated and has a long history of scientific research. However, understanding of physical and biological processes driven by the EAC, particularly in linking circulation to ecosystems, is limited. In this special issue of 16 papers on the EAC, we examine the effects of climatic wind-stress forced ocean dynamics on EAC transport variability and coastal sea level, from ENSO to multi-decadal time scales; eddy formation and structure; fine scale connectivity and larval retention. Comparisons with the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current on Australia’s west coast show differences in ecosystem productivity that can be attributed to the underlying physics in each region. On average there is double the chlorophyll a concentration on the east coast than the west. In comparison to the Leeuwin, the EAC may have less local retention of larvae and act as a partial barrier to onshore transport, which may also be related to the local spawning and early life history of small pelagic fish on each coast. Inter-annual variations in the EAC transport produce a detectable sea-level signal in Sydney Harbour, which could provide a useful fisheries index as does the Fremantle sea level and Leeuwin Current relationship. The EAC’s eddy structure and formation by the EAC are examined. A particular cold-core eddy is shown to have a “tilt” towards the coast, and that during a rotation the flow of particles may rise up to the euphotic zone and then down beneath. In a warm-core eddy, surface flooding is shown to produce a new shallower surface mixed layer and promote algal growth. An assessment of plankton data from 1938–1942 showed that the local, synoptic conditions had to be incorporated before any comparison with the present. There are useful relationships of water mass characteristics in the Tasman Sea and separation zone with larval fish diversity and abundance, as well as with long-line fisheries. These fisheries-pelagic habitat relationships are invaluable for fisheries management, as well as for climate change assessments. There is further need to examine the EAC influence on rainfall, storm activity, dust deposition, and on the movements by fish, sharks and whales. The Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) has provided new infrastructure to determine the changing behaviour of the EAC and its bio-physical interaction with the coasts and estuaries. The forecasting and hindcasting capability developed under the Bluelink project has provided a new tool for data synthesis and dynamical analysis. The impact of a strengthening EAC and how it influences the livelihoods of over half the Australian population, from Brisbane to Sydney, Hobart and Melbourne, is just being realised.","tags":null,"title":"The strengthening East Australian Current, its eddies and biological effects — an introduction and overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D Everett","Mark E Baird","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563864763,"objectID":"d25f301610002c3e2e62417f2b3a6e5b","permalink":"/publication/everett-2007/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.371574Z","relpermalink":"/publication/everett-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"A spatially resolved, eleven-box ecological model is presented for an Intermittently Closed and Open Lake or Lagoon (ICOLL), configured for Smiths Lake, NSW Australia.

The process descriptions in the ecological model are based on a combination of physical and physiological limits to the processes of nutrient uptake, light capture by phytoplankton and predator–prey interactions. An inverse model is used to calculate mixing coefficients from salinity observations. When compared to field data, the ecological model obtains a fit for salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a and zooplankton which is within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean of the field data. Simulations show that nutrient limitation (nitrogen and phosphorus) is the dominant factor limiting growth of the autotrophic state variables during both the open and closed phases of the lake. The model is characterised by strong oscillations in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, typical of predator–prey cycles. There is an increase in the productivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton during the open phase.
