Most studies on the topic take place within eastern boundary systems, where the intensity and frequency of upwelling are high. Here, we test the generality of the IUH towards the other end of the upwelling spectrum, within two regions located at similar latitudes along western boundary currents of two continents. We measured barnacle recruitment and colonisation, which we expected to be linked positively to productivity, across eight rocky shores along the east coasts of South Africa and Australia selected to capture a range of upwelling regimes. Based on Bakun Upwelling Indices (BUI), the four South African sites experienced persistent to intermittent levels of upwelling, whilst the four sites along the east coast of Australia were predominantly downwelling sites with occasional upwelling events. Satellite chlorophyll a concentrations ([Chl-a]) also showed a marked difference between the two continents, with 2–3 times higher concentrations in South Africa than Australia. In situ sea temperature measurements revealed slightly different oceanographic patterns, which were nonetheless compatible with both BUI and [Chl-a] measurements. Barnacle recruitment was typically greater within South Africa and but was generally found to vary unimodally with mean BUI (i.e. being greater at sites that experienced moderate upwelling conditions) and to increase linearly with increasing upwelling frequency between January and April when barnacle larvae are known to be most abundant in the water column. Viewed in isolation, our data provide moderate support for the IUH. But when placed in a broader context, with our eight study locations representing just one end of the upwelling continuum, they provide strong evidence for the IUH.","tags":null,"title":"Testing the intermittent upwelling hypothesis: Intercontinental comparisons of barnacle recruitment between South Africa and Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon B Z Gorta","James A Smith","Jason D Everett","Richard T Kingsford","William K Cornwell","Iain M Suthers","Hal Epstein","Roger McGovern","Greg McLachlan","Mick Roderick","Lindsay Smith","Dan Williams","Corey T Callaghan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563854503,"objectID":"da9923d71aeeae6fcb9cf97411f900f9","permalink":"/publication/gorta-2019-gs/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.370529Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gorta-2019-gs/","section":"publication","summary":"Many seabird communities are declining around the world, a trend frequently linked to climate change and human impacts on habitat and prey.

An Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator particle tracking model was used to assess the potential dispersal of Eastern King Prawn (EKP) larvae Melicertus (Penaeus) plebejus, an important commercial and recreational species in Eastern Australia. Particles were exposed to a constant natural mortality rate, and temperature-dependent growth (degree-days) was used to determine the time of settlement. Forward and backward simulations were used to identify the extent of larval dispersal from key source locations, and to determine the putative spawning regions for four settlement sites. The mean dispersal distance for larvae was extensive (~750–1,000~km before settlement), yet the northern spawning locations were unlikely to contribute larvae to the most southern extent of the EKP range. There was generally great offshore dispersal of larvae, with only 2%–5% of larvae on the continental shelf at the time of settlement. Our particle tracking results were combined with existing site-specific reproductive potentials to identify the relative contributions of larvae from key source locations. Although mid-latitude sites had only moderate reproductive potential, they delivered the most particles to the southern coast and are probably the most important sources of larval EKP for the two southern estuaries. Our modelling suggests that mesoscale oceanography is a strong determinant of recruitment success of the EKP, and highlights the importance of both larval dispersal and reproductive potential for understanding connectivity across a speciestextquoteright range.","tags":null,"title":"Dispersal of Eastern King Prawn larvae in a western boundary current: New insights from particle tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C M Robinson","N Cherukuru","N J Hardman-Mountford","Jason D Everett","M J McLaughlin","K P Davies","V Van Dongen-Vogels","P J Ralph","M A Doblin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563854503,"objectID":"c1266ab16251b738e4573a1a7777a81c","permalink":"/publication/robinson-2017-du/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.378895Z","relpermalink":"/publication/robinson-2017-du/","section":"publication","summary":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 192 (2017) 1-16. doi:10.1016/j.ecss.2017.04.012","tags":null,"title":"Phytoplankton absorption predicts patterns in primary productivity in Australian coastal shelf waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica Melbourne-Thomas","Andrew J Constable","Elizabeth A Fulton","Stuart P Corney","Rowan Trebilco","Alistair J Hobday","Julia L Blanchard","Fabio Boschetti","Rodrigo H Bustamante","Roger Cropp","Jason D Everett","Aysha Fleming","Ben Galton-Fenzi","Simon D Goldsworthy","Andrew Lenton","Ana Lara-Lopez","Rich Little","Martin P Marzloff","Richard Matear","Mathieu Mongin","Éva Plagányi","Roger Proctor","James S Risbey","Barbara J Robson","David C Smith","Michael D Sumner","E Ingrid van Putten"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563854503,"objectID":"16d512274ae05d4f71888eb5d869f8fe","permalink":"/publication/melbourne-thomas-2017-ku/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.383233Z","relpermalink":"/publication/melbourne-thomas-2017-ku/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Integrated modelling to support decision-making for marine social–ecological systems in Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephanie Brodie","Alistair J Hobday","James A Smith","Claire M Spillman","Jason R Hartog","Jason D Everett","Matthew D Taylor","Charles A Gray","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563854503,"objectID":"05545883e4a6b64699419dbe7ac65bae","permalink":"/publication/brodie-2017-ki/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.359322Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brodie-2017-ki/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep-Sea Research Part II,Corrected proof,doi:10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.03.004","tags":null,"title":"Seasonal forecasting of dolphinfish distribution in eastern Australia to aid recreational fishers and managers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J L Blanchard","R F Heneghan","Jason D Everett","Rowan Trebilco","A J Richardson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563854503,"objectID":"4a82ae2207571dca7eec9bc6bb43c879","permalink":"/publication/blanchard-2017-vd/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T10:54:19.363288Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blanchard-2017-vd/","section":"publication","summary":"Size-based ecosystem modeling is emerging as a powerful way to assess ecosystem-level impacts of human-and environment-driven changes from individual-level processes.

We show that salps play a major role in carbon sequestration and are key components of marine food webs as a food source for at least 202 species including fish, turtles, and crustaceans. The future of salps in the Anthropocene is uncertain, and therefore further research into areas such as basic rate processes and their biogeochemical impact through new and innovative laboratory and

Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) advect warm, low nutrient waters into temperate latitudes, displacing more productive waters. WBCs also influence phytoplankton distribution and growth through current-induced upwelling, mesoscale eddy intrusion and seasonal changes in strength and poleward penetration. Here we examine dynamics of chlorophyll a (Chl. a) in the western Pacific Ocean, a region strongly influenced by the East Australian Current (EAC). We interpreted a spatial and temporal analysis of satellite-derived surface Chl. a, using a hydrodynamic model, a wind-reanalysis product and an altimetry-derived eddy-census. Our analysis revealed regions of persistently elevated surface Chl. a along the continental shelf and showed that different processes have a dominant effect in different locations. In the northern and central zones, upwelling events tend to regulate surface Chl. a patterns, with peaks in phytoplankton biomass corresponding to two known upwelling locations south of Cape Byron (28.5°S) and Smoky Cape (31°S). Within the central EAC separation zone, positive surface Chl. a anomalies occurred 65% of the time when both wind-stress ($τ$w) and bottom-stress ($τ$B) were upwelling-favourable, and only 17% of the time when both were downwelling-favourable. The interaction of wind and the EAC was a critical driver of surface Chl. a dynamics, with upwelling-favourable $τ$W resulting in a 70% increase in surface Chl. a at some locations, when compared to downwelling-favourable $τ$W. In the southern zone, surface Chl. a was driven by a strong seasonal cycle, with phytoplankton biomass increasing up to 152% annually each spring. The Stockton Bight region (32.25–33.25°S) contained ⩾20% of the total shelf Chl. a on 27% of occasions due to its location downstream of upwelling locations, wide shelf area and reduced surface velocities. This region is analogous to productive fisheries regions in the Aghulus Current (Natal Bight) and Kuroshio Current (Enshu-nada Sea). These patterns of phytoplankton biomass show contrasting temporal dynamics north and south of the central EAC separation zone with more episodic upwelling-driven Chl. a anomalies to the north, compared with regular annual spring bloom dynamics to the south. We expect changes in the strength of the EAC to have greater influence on shelf phytoplankton dynamics to the north of the separation zone.","tags":null,"title":"Relative impact of seasonal and
