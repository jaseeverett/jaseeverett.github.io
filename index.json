Trait-based approaches—where zooplankton are represented with functional traits such as body size—could help improve the resolution of zooplankton in marine ecosystem models and their role in trophic transfer and carbon sequestration. Here, we present the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra version 2 (ZooMSSv2), a functional size-spectrum model that resolves nine major zooplankton functional groups (heterotrophic flagellates, heterotrophic ciliates, larvaceans, omnivorous copepods, carnivorous copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, salps and jellyfish). Each group is represented by the functional traits of body size, size-based feeding characteristics and carbon content. The model is run globally at 5° resolution to steady-state using long-term average temperature and chlorophyll a for each grid-cell. Zooplankton community composition emerges based on the relative fitness of the different groups. Emergent steady-state patterns of global zooplankton abundance, biomass and growth rates agree well with empirical data, and the model is robust to changes in the boundary conditions of the zooplankton. We use the model to consider the role of the zooplankton groups in supporting higher trophic levels, by exploring the sensitivity of steady-state fish biomass to the removal of individual zooplankton groups across the global ocean. Our model shows zooplankton play a key role in supporting fish biomass in the global ocean. For example, the removal of euphausiids or omnivorous copepods caused fish biomass to decrease by up to 80\\%. By contrast, the removal of carnivorous copepods caused fish biomass to increase by up to 75\\%. Our results suggest that including zooplankton complexity in ecosystem models could be key to better understanding the distribution of fish biomass and trophic efficiency across the global ocean.","tags":[],"title":"A functional size-spectrum model of the global marine ecosystem that resolves zooplankton composition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kieran J.

Quantifying trophic position–individual body size relationships (trophic allometries) underpins the development of size‐structured ecosystem models to predict abundance and the transfer of energy through ecosystems. Trophic allometries are well studied for fishes but remain relatively unexplored for cephalopods. Cephalopods are important components of coastal, oceanic and deep‐sea ecosystems, and they play a key role in the transfer of biomass from low trophic positions to higher predators. It is therefore important to resolve cephalopod trophic allometries to accurately represent them within size‐structured ecosystem models. We assessed the trophic positions of cephalopods in an oceanic pelagic (0–500 m) community (sampled by trawling in a cold‐core eddy in the western Tasman Sea), comprising 22 species from 12 families, using bulk tissue stable isotope analysis and amino acid compound‐specific stable isotope analysis. We assessed whether ontogenetic trophic position shifts were evident at the species‐level and tested for the best predictor of community‐level trophic allometry among body size, taxonomy and functional grouping (informed by fin and mantle morphology). Individuals in this cephalopod community spanned two trophic positions and fell into three functional groups on an activity level gradient: low, medium and high. The relationship between trophic position and ontogeny varied among species, with the most marked differences evident between species from different functional groups. Activity‐level‐based functional group and individual body size are best explained by cephalopod trophic positions (marginal R2 = 0.43). Our results suggest that the morphological traits used to infer activity level, such as fin‐to‐mantle length ratio, fin musculature and mantle musculature are strong predictors of cephalopod trophic allometries. Contrary to established theory, not all cephalopods are voracious predators. Low activity level cephalopods have a distinct feeding mode, with low trophic positions and little‐to‐no ontogenetic increases. Given the important role of cephalopods in marine ecosystems, distinct feeding modes could have important consequences for energy pathways and ecosystem structure and function. These findings will facilitate trait‐based and other model estimates of cephalopod abundance in the changing global ocean. The authors found that oceanic cephalopods have distinct trophic roles, which are explained by body size and activity level. This insight will improve our capacity to understand the structure and function of marine ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Functional traits explain trophic allometries of cephalopods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew M.

In coastal ecosystems, the relative abundance of feeding guilds indicates dominant energy sources sustaining food webs. Here, we use a space‐for‐time substitution to investigate potential climate change impacts on trophic structure and energy flow in reef fish communities. We investigated latitudinal and seasonal patterns in the biomass distribution of five trophic groups across subtropical to temperate latitudes (29 to 44°S) in eastern Australia. Along western boundary currents, temperatures are increasing up to three times faster than the global average, making them ideal for studying climate change impacts. Using 10 years of Reef Life Survey data, we investigated potential determinants of fish biomass and community composition with generalized additive mixed models. Biomass decreased towards higher latitudes, from 220 g/m2 in the subtropics to 13 g/m2 in the south. Dominant trophic group also changed latitudinally, with herbivores and omnivores dominating lower latitudes (\\textbackslashtextasciitilde30°S), zooplanktivores at mid‐latitudes (\\textbackslashtextasciitilde35°S) and benthic invertivores at higher latitudes (\\textbackslashtextasciitilde40°S). Biomass varied seasonally, with lower latitudes experiencing a 3.2‐fold increase between spring and autumn, while variation at higher latitudes was 1.9‐fold. We found strong evidence that factors linked to latitude and seasonality are important determinants in the distribution of fish trophic structure. As climate‐driven species redistributions accelerate in the 21st century, expected poleward shifts in trophic structure include overall increases in fish biomass linked to enhanced herbivory at mid‐latitudes and increased planktivory at higher latitudes.","tags":[],"title":"Latitudinal patterns in trophic structure of temperate reef‐associated fishes and predicted consequences of climate change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lian E.

Depth stratified mesozooplankton and micronekton were collected using a Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) and an International Young Gadoid Pelagic Trawl (IYGPT) equipped with an opening/closing codend. Sampling was undertaken at the center and edge of a frontal cold-core eddy (F-CCE Center and Edge) in 2015, and at the center of a cold-core eddy (B-CCE) and two warm-core eddies (R-WCE and WCE) in 2017. We assess the diel vertical structure, biomass, and downward active carbon transport by mesozooplankton and micronekton in eddies. Total water column mesozooplankton and micronekton biomass did not vary substantially across water masses, while the extent and depth of diel vertical migration did. Using in situ measurements of temperature and measurements of mesozooplankton and micronekton abundance and biomass, we estimated the contribution of respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion, gut flux, and mortality to total downward active carbon transport in each water mass. Overall, active carbon transport by mesozooplankton and micronekton below the mixed layer varied substantially across water masses. We corrected estimates of micronekton migratory biomass and active carbon transport assuming 50\\% net efficiency. In the R-WCE mesozooplankton remained within the mixed layer during the day and night; only 50\\% of the total micronekton population migrated below the mixed layer contributing to carbon transport, equating to 2.89 mg C m–2 d–1. Mesozooplankton actively transported 16.1 and 8.0 mg C m–2 d–1 at the F-CCE Center and Edge, respectively. Mesozooplankton and micronekton active carbon transport in the B-CCE were 5.4 and 0.74 mg C m–2 d–1, and in the WCE 88 and 13.4 mg C m–2 d–1. Differences in carbon export were dependent on food availability, temperature, time spent migrating, and mixed layer depth.

The timing and location of spawning can have a large influence on settlement location. Shifts in the known spawning habitat of fish, whether due to climate or the discovery of new spawning stock, can influence the distribution of juveniles and our understanding of connectivity. The globally distributed species; Pomatomus saltatrix, is one such example where a previously unrecognised summer spawning event and a more southern latitudinal extent was recently reported for the southwest Pacific population. Although restrictions are in place to protect the traditional spawning event, the importance of the newly recognised summer spawning event is uncertain. Here, we investigate larval dispersal of P. saltatrix using particle tracking simulations to identify the contributions of the different spawning events to settlement. By modelling dispersal of larvae released in northern and mid‐latitude regions over the Austral spring and summer, we show that the newly recognised mid‐latitude summer spawning event contributes over 50\\% of the larvae reaching southern latitudes. This is due to a reduced (1–2 days) pelagic larval duration (associated with temperature), resulting in reduced larval mortality, and the seasonal (summer) strengthening of the East Australian Current (EAC) transporting particles \\textbackslashtextasciitilde50 km further south. These findings demonstrate that in dynamic boundary current systems such as the EAC, the final settlement location of larvae that are transported by ocean currents can vary considerably depending on the timing and location of spawning and that multiple spawning events are important for maximum dispersal.","tags":[],"title":"Multiple spawning events promote increased larval dispersal of a predatory fish in a western boundary current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D.

Their clearance rates are among the highest of any zooplankton grazer, and they can rapidly repackage what they consume into thousands of fecal pellets per hour. In recent years, pyrosome swarms have been found outside of their natural geographical range; however, environmental drivers that promote these swarms are still unknown. During the austral spring of 2017 a Pyrosoma atlanticum swarm was sampled in the Tasman Sea. Depth‐stratified sampling during the day and night was used to examine the spatial and vertical distribution of P. atlanticum across three eddies. Respiration rate experiments were performed onboard to determine minimum feeding requirements for the pyrosome population. P. atlanticum was 2 orders of magnitude more abundant in the cold core eddy (CCE) compared to both warm core eddies, with maximum biomass of 360 mg WW·m−3, most likely driven by high chlorophyll a concentrations. P. atlanticum exhibited diel vertical migration and migrated to a maximum depth strata of 800–1,000 m. Active carbon transport in the CCE was 4 orders of magnitude higher than the warm core eddies. Fecal pellet production contributed to the majority (91\\%) of transport, and total downward carbon flux below the mixed layer was estimated at 11 mg C·m−2·d−1. When abundant, P. atlanticum swarms have the potential to play a major role in active carbon transport, comparable to fluxes for zooplankton and micronekton communities. Pyrosomes are a gelatinous zooplankton that can form large swarms. They feed through filtration and are among the most efficient filter feeders of any zooplankton, repackaging what they consume into thousands of fecal pellets per hour. As pyrosomes migrate vertically to 800 m daily, they have the potential to transport the carbon they consume at the surface to these depths. In the austral spring of 2017 we sampled a pyrosome swarm in the Tasman Sea.

To estimate temporal trends and environmental drivers, we used generalised additive modelling and species archetype modelling for groups. Almost half (43\\%) of the most abundant seabird species declined in our study area over the 17 years. The declines may be associated with human-induced ecosystem change and represent poleward shifts in distribution out of our study area, changes in population abundance, or both. Winter-dominant groups, primarily species rarely frequenting warmer water, were often negatively associated with SST anom , while summer-dominant groups, composed of species more tolerant of temperate and tropical environments, were generally positively associated with SST anom . Widespread local declines in seabird populations are of increasing concern. Understanding the extent to which these observed declines represent real declines in abundance, or range shifts, should be a priority. Changing sea temperatures are probably contributing to both. These results from the coast of south-eastern Australia need to be placed in the context of the highly mobile study organisms and the vast spatial scale of the ocean.

Here, we test the generality of the IUH towards the other end of the upwelling spectrum, within two regions located at similar latitudes along western boundary currents of two continents. We measured barnacle recruitment and colonisation, which we expected to be linked positively to productivity, across eight rocky shores along the east coasts of South Africa and Australia selected to capture a range of upwelling regimes. Based on Bakun Upwelling Indices (BUI), the four South African sites experienced persistent to intermittent levels of upwelling, whilst the four sites along the east coast of Australia were predominantly downwelling sites with occasional upwelling events. Satellite chlorophyll a concentrations ([Chl-a]) also showed a marked difference between the two continents, with 2–3 times higher concentrations in South Africa than Australia. In situ sea temperature measurements revealed slightly different oceanographic patterns, which were nonetheless compatible with both BUI and [Chl-a] measurements. Barnacle recruitment was typically greater within South Africa and but was generally found to vary unimodally with mean BUI (i.e. being greater at sites that experienced moderate upwelling conditions) and to increase linearly with increasing upwelling frequency between January and April when barnacle larvae are known to be most abundant in the water column. Viewed in isolation, our data provide moderate support for the IUH. But when placed in a broader context, with our eight study locations representing just one end of the upwelling continuum, they provide strong evidence for the IUH.","tags":[],"title":"Testing the intermittent upwelling hypothesis: Intercontinental comparisons of barnacle recruitment between South Africa and Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A.

The high level of taxonomic expertise required to identify larval fishes to species level, and the considerable effort required to collect samples, make these data very valuable. Here we collate 3178 samples of larval fish assemblages, from 12 research projects from 1983-present, from temperate and subtropical Australian pelagic waters. This forms a benchmark for the larval fish assemblage for the region, and includes recent monitoring of larval fishes at coastal oceanographic reference stations. Comparing larval fishes among projects can be problematic due to differences in taxonomic resolution, and identifying all taxa to species is challenging, so this study reports a standard taxonomic resolution (of 218 taxa) for this region to help guide future research. This larval fish database serves as a data repository for surveys of larval fish assemblages in the region, and can contribute to analysis of climate-driven changes in the location and timing of the spawning of marine fishes.","tags":[],"title":"A database of marine larval fish assemblages in Australian temperate and subtropical waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["HT Schilling","P Reis-Santos","JM Hughes","JA Smith","JD Everett","J Stewart","BM Gillanders","IM Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"3d1fd4f30438009091f60f6edf4d2340","permalink":"/publication/2018-01-01_schilling.2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-01-01_schilling.2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating estuarine nursery use and life history patterns of Pomatomus saltatrix in eastern Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D.

An Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator particle tracking model was used to assess the potential dispersal of Eastern King Prawn (EKP) larvae Melicertus (Penaeus) plebejus, an important commercial and recreational species in Eastern Australia. Particles were exposed to a constant natural mortality rate, and temperature-dependent growth (degree-days) was used to determine the time of settlement. Forward and backward simulations were used to identify the extent of larval dispersal from key source locations, and to determine the putative spawning regions for four settlement sites. The mean dispersal distance for larvae was extensive (\\textbackslashtextasciitilde750–1,000 km before settlement), yet the northern spawning locations were unlikely to contribute larvae to the most southern extent of the EKP range. There was generally great offshore dispersal of larvae, with only 2\\%–5\\% of larvae on the continental shelf at the time of settlement. Our particle tracking results were combined with existing site-specific reproductive potentials to identify the relative contributions of larvae from key source locations. Although mid-latitude sites had only moderate reproductive potential, they delivered the most particles to the southern coast and are probably the most important sources of larval EKP for the two southern estuaries. Our modelling suggests that mesoscale oceanography is a strong determinant of recruitment success of the EKP, and highlights the importance of both larval dispersal and reproductive potential for understanding connectivity across a species’ range.","tags":[],"title":"Dispersal of Eastern King Prawn larvae in a western boundary current: New insights from particle tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia L.

Central to many assessments are statistical and dynamical models of populations, communities, ecosystems, and their socioeconomic systems and management frameworks. The establishment of a national system that could facilitate the development of such model-based assessments has been identified as a priority for addressing management challenges for Australia’s marine environment. Given that most assessments require cross-scale information, individual models cannot capture all of the spatial, temporal, biological, and socioeconomic scales that are typically needed. Coupling or integrating models across scales and domains can expand the scope for developing comprehensive and internally consistent, system-level assessments, including higher-level feedbacks in social–ecological systems. In this article, we summarize: (i) integrated modelling for marine systems currently being undertaken in Australia, (ii) methods used for integration and comparison of models, and (iii) improvements to facilitate further integration, particularly with respect to standards and specifications. We consider future needs for integrated modelling of marine social–ecological systems in Australia and provide a set of recommendations for priority focus areas in the development of a national approach to integrated modelling. These recommendations draw on—and have broader relevance for—international efforts around integrated modelling to inform decision-making for marine systems.","tags":[],"title":"Integrated modelling to support decision-making for marine social–ecological systems in Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D.

Given zooplankton's importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by filling three gaps. The first is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical, ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton. The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations provides the necessary context to address the last gap—a blueprint for model assessment of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling What We Sample and Sampling What We Model: Challenges for Zooplankton Model Assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.M.

We compiled a dataset of surface bio-optical properties and phytoplankton NPP measurements in coastal waters around Australia to examine the utility of an in-situ absorption model to estimate NPP. The magnitude of surface NPP (0.20–19.3 mmol C m−3 d−1) across sites was largely driven by phytoplankton biomass, with higher rates being attributed to the microplankton (20 μm) size class. The phytoplankton absorption coefficient aPHY for PAR (photosynthetically active radiation; āPHY)) ranged from 0.003 to 0.073 m-1, influenced by changes in phytoplankton community composition, physiology and environmental conditions. The aPHY coefficient also reflected changes in NPP and the absorption model-derived NPP could explain 73\\% of the variability in measured surface NPP (n = 41; RMSE = 2.49). The absorption model was applied to two contrasting coastal locations to examine NPP dynamics: a high chlorophyll-high variation (HCHV; Port Hacking National Reference Station) and moderate chlorophyll-low variation (MCLV; Yongala National Reference Station) location in eastern Australia using the GIOP-DC satellite aPHY product. Mean daily NPP rates between 2003 and 2015 were higher at the HCHV site (1.71 ± 0.03 mmol C m−3 d−1) with the annual maximum NPP occurring during the austral winter. In contrast, the MCLV site annual NPP peak occurred during the austral wet season and had lower mean daily NPP (1.43 ± 0.03 mmol C m−3 d−1) across the time-series.

Here, a seasonal forecast of the habitat and density of dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), based on sea surface temperatures, was developed for the east coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Two prototype forecast products were created; geographic spatial forecasts of dolphinfish habitat and a latitudinal summary identifying the location of fish density peaks. The less detailed latitudinal summary was created to limit the resolution of habitat information to prevent potential resource over-exploitation by fishers in the absence of total catch controls. The forecast dolphinfish habitat model was accurate at the start of the annual dolphinfish migration in NSW (December) but other months (January - May) showed poor performance due to spatial and temporal variability in the catch data used in model validation. Habitat forecasts for December were useful up to five months ahead, with performance decreasing as forecast were made further into the future. The continued development and sound application of seasonal forecasts will help fishery industries cope with future uncertainty and promote dynamic and sustainable marine resource management.","tags":[],"title":"Seasonal forecasting of dolphinfish distribution in eastern Australia to aid recreational fishers and managers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natasha Henschke","Jason D.

This seabird feeds on low trophic level species that are sensitive to environmental change. We found that in 2012, prey capture success by penguins was high when SST was low relative to the long-term mean. In 2013 prey capture success was low, coincident with an unusually strong penetration of warm water. Overall there was an optimal temperature range for prey capture around 19–21 °C, with lower success at both lower and higher temperatures, mirroring published relationships between commercial sardine catch and SST. Spatially, higher SSTs corresponded to a lower probability of penguins using an area, and lower prey capture success.

To understand eddy-induced changes in microbial community composition as well as how they control growth, we targeted the East Australian Current (EAC) region to sample microbes in a cyclonic (cold-core) eddy (CCE) and the adjacent EAC. Phototrophic and diazotrophic microbes were more diverse (2–10 times greater Shannon index) in the CCE relative to the EAC, and the cell size distribution in the CCE was dominated (67\\%) by larger micro-plankton ≥ 20 μ m , as opposed to pico- and nano-sized cells in the EAC. Nutrient addition experiments determined that nitrogen was the principal nutrient limiting growth in the EAC, while iron was a secondary limiting nutrient in the CCE. Among the diazotrophic community, heterotrophic NifH gene sequences dominated in the EAC and were attributable to members of the gamma-, beta-, and delta-proteobacteria, while the CCE contained both phototrophic and heterotrophic diazotrophs, including Trichodesmium, UCYN-A and gamma-proteobacteria. Daily sampling of incubation bottles following nutrient amendment captured a cascade of effects at the cellular, population and community level, indicating taxon-specific differences in the speed of response of microbes to nutrient supply. Nitrogen addition to the CCE community increased picoeukaryote chlorophyll a quotas within 24 h, suggesting that nutrient uplift by eddies causes a ‘greening’ effect as well as an increase in phytoplankton biomass. After three days in both the EAC and CCE, diatoms increased in abundance with macronutrient (N, P, Si) and iron amendment, whereas haptophytes and phototrophic dinoflagellates declined. Our results indicate that cyclonic eddies increase delivery of nitrogen to the upper ocean to potentially mitigate the negative consequences of increased stratification due to ocean warming, but also increase the biological demand for iron that is necessary to sustain the growth of large-celled phototrophs and potentially support the diversity of diazotrophs over longer time-scales.","tags":[],"title":"Nutrient uplift in a cyclonic eddy increases diversity, primary productivity and iron demand of microbial communities relative to a western boundary current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natasha Henschke","Jason D.

Recent advances have improved the realism of the fish component of the size-spectrum, but these often assume that small fish feed on an aggregated plankton size-spectrum, without any explicit representation of zooplankton dynamics. In these models, small zooplankton are grouped with phytoplankton as a resource for larval fish, and large zooplankton are parameterized as small fish. Here, we investigate the impact of resolving zooplankton and their feeding traits in a dynamic size-spectrum model. First, we compare a base model, where zooplankton are parameterized as smaller fish, to a model that includes zooplankton-specific feeding parameters. Second, we evaluate how the parameterization of zooplankton feeding characteristics, specifically the predator–prey mass ratio (PPMR), assimilation efficiency and feeding kernel width, affects the productivity and stability of the fish community. Finally, we compare how feeding characteristics of different zooplankton functional groups mediate increases in primary production and fishing pressure. Incorporating zooplankton-specific feeding parameters increased productivity of the fish community, but also changed the dynamics of the entire system from a stable to an oscillating steady-state. The inclusion of zooplankton feeding characteristics mediated a trade-off between the productivity and resilience of the fish community, and its stability. Fish communities with increased productivity and lower stability were supported by zooplankton with a larger PPMR and a narrower feeding kernel–specialized herbivores. In contrast, fish communities that were stable had lower productivity, and were supported by zooplankton with a lower PPMR and a wider feeding kernel—generalist carnivores. Herbivorous zooplankton communities were more efficient at mediating increases in primary production, and supported fish communities more resilient to fishing. Our results illustrate that zooplankton are not just a static food source for larger organisms, nor can they be resolved as very small fish.

Thousands of estimates of marine PP exist globally, but there remain significant gaps in data availability, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. In situ PP estimates are generally single-point measurements and therefore we rely on satellite models of PP in order to scale up over time and space. To reduce the uncertainty around the model output, these models need to be assessed against in situ measurements before use. This study examined the vertically-integrated productivity in four water-masses associated with the East Australian Current (EAC), the major western boundary current (WBC) of the South Pacific. We calculated vertically integrated PP from shipboard 14C PP estimates and then compared them to estimates from four commonly used satellite models (ESQRT, VGPM, VGPM-Eppley, VGPM-Kameda) to assess their utility for this region. Vertical profiles of the water-column show each water-mass had distinct temperature–salinity signatures. The depth of the fluorescence-maximum (fmax) increased from onshore (river plume) to offshore (EAC) as light penetration increased. Depth integrated PP was highest in river plumes (792±181mgCm−2d−1) followed by the EAC (534±116mgCm−2d−1), continental shelf (140±47mgCm−2d−1) and cyclonic eddy waters (121±4mgCm−2d−1). Surface carbon assimilation efficiency was greatest in the EAC (301±145mgC (mgChl-a)−1d−1) compared to other water masses. All satellite primary production models tested underestimated EAC PP and overestimated continental shelf PP. The ESQRT model had the highest skill and lowest bias of the tested models, providing the best first-order estimates of PP on the continental shelf, including at a coastal time-series station, Port Hacking, which showed considerable inter-annual variability (155–2957mgCm−2d−1). This work provides the first estimates of depth integrated PP associated with the East Australian Current in temperate Australia. The ongoing intensification of all WBCs makes it critical to understand the variability in PP at the regional scale. More accurate predictions in the EAC region will require vertically-resolved in situ productivity and bio-optical measurements across multiple time scales to allow development of other models which simulate dynamic ocean conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Characterising primary productivity measurements across a dynamic western boundary current region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The distribution of patches of shelf water observed within the eddy was consistent with the spiral pattern shown within the numerical simulations. A numerical dye tracer experiment showed that the surface waters (≤50 m depth) of the frontal eddy are almost entirely (≥95\\%) shelf waters.

Consistent with the glider observations, the modeled particles entrained into the eddy sunk relative to their initial position. Particles released south of 33°S, where the waters are cooler and denser, sunk 34 m deeper than their release position. Distance to the shelf was a critical factor in determining the volume of shelf water entrained into the eddy. Entrainment reduced to 0.23 Sv when the eddy was furthest from the shelf, compared to 0.61 Sv when the eddy was within 10 km of the shelf. From a biological perspective, quantifying the entrainment of shelf water into frontal eddies is important, as it is thought to play a significant role in providing an offshore nursery habitat for coastally spawned larval fish.","tags":[],"title":"Cyclonic entrainment of preconditioned shelf waters into a frontal eddy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephanie Brodie","Alistair J.

This can be achieved using species distribution models that include physical environmental predictors. In the present study, species distribution models that describe the seasonal habitats of two pelagic fish (dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus and yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi), are developed using 19 yr of presence-only data from a recreational angler-based catch-and-release fishing programme. A Poisson point process model within a generalized additive modelling framework was used to determine the species distributions off the east coast of Australia as a function of several oceanographic covariates. This modelling framework uses presence-only data to determine the intensity of fish (fish km−2), rather than a probability of fish presence. Sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomaly, SST frontal index and eddy kinetic energy were significant environmental predictors for both dolphinfish and kingfish distributions. Models for both species indicate a greater fish intensity off the east Australian coast during summer and autumn in response to the regional oceanography, namely shelf incursions by the East Australian Current.

Zooplankton and suspended particulate organic matter (POM) were sampled in three different water types in the western Tasman Sea: inner shelf (IS), a cold core eddy (CCE) and a warm core eddy (WCE). δ15N values ranged from 3.9‰ for the parasitic copepod Sapphirina augusta to 10.2‰ for the euphausiid, Euphausia spinifera. δ13C varied from −22.6 to −19.4‰ as a result of the copepod Euchirella curticauda and E. spinifera. The isotopic composition of POM varied significantly among water types; as did the trophic enrichment of zooplankton over POM, with the lowest enrichment in the recently upwelled IS water type (0.5‰) compared to the warm core eddy (1.6‰) and cold core eddy (2.7‰). The WCE was an oligotrophic environment and was associated with an increased trophic level for omnivorous zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids) to a similar level as carnivorous zooplankton (chaetognaths). Therefore carnivory in zooplankton can increase in response to lower abundance and reduced diversity in their phytoplankton and protozoan prey. Trophic niche width comparisons across three zooplankton species: the salp Thalia democratica, the copepod Eucalanus elongatus and the euphausiid Thysanoessa gregaria, indicated that both niche partitioning and competition can occur within the zooplankton community. We have shown that trophic relationships among the zooplankton are dynamic and respond to different water types. The changes to the zooplankton isotopic niche, however, were still highly variable as result of oceanographic variation within water types.","tags":[],"title":"Zooplankton trophic niches respond to different water types of the western Tasman Sea: A stable isotope analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natasha Henschke","Jason D.

WBCs also influence phytoplankton distribution and growth through current-induced upwelling, mesoscale eddy intrusion and seasonal changes in strength and poleward penetration. Here we examine dynamics of chlorophyll a (Chl. a) in the western Pacific Ocean, a region strongly influenced by the East Australian Current (EAC). We interpreted a spatial and temporal analysis of satellite-derived surface Chl. a, using a hydrodynamic model, a wind-reanalysis product and an altimetry-derived eddy-census. Our analysis revealed regions of persistently elevated surface Chl. a along the continental shelf and showed that different processes have a dominant effect in different locations. In the northern and central zones, upwelling events tend to regulate surface Chl. a patterns, with peaks in phytoplankton biomass corresponding to two known upwelling locations south of Cape Byron (28.5°S) and Smoky Cape (31°S). Within the central EAC separation zone, positive surface Chl. a anomalies occurred 65\\% of the time when both wind-stress (τw) and bottom-stress (τB) were upwelling-favourable, and only 17\\% of the time when both were downwelling-favourable. The interaction of wind and the EAC was a critical driver of surface Chl. a dynamics, with upwelling-favourable τW resulting in a 70\\% increase in surface Chl. a at some locations, when compared to downwelling-favourable τW. In the southern zone, surface Chl. a was driven by a strong seasonal cycle, with phytoplankton biomass increasing up to 152\\% annually each spring. The Stockton Bight region (32.25–33.25°S) contained ⩾20\\% of the total shelf Chl. a on 27\\% of occasions due to its location downstream of upwelling locations, wide shelf area and reduced surface velocities. This region is analogous to productive fisheries regions in the Aghulus Current (Natal Bight) and Kuroshio Current (Enshu-nada Sea). These patterns of phytoplankton biomass show contrasting temporal dynamics north and south of the central EAC separation zone with more episodic upwelling-driven Chl. a anomalies to the north, compared with regular annual spring bloom dynamics to the south. We expect changes in the strength of the EAC to have greater influence on shelf phytoplankton dynamics to the north of the separation zone.","tags":[],"title":"Relative impact of seasonal and oceanographic drivers on surface chlorophyll a along a Western Boundary Current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Henschke","DA Bowden","JD Everett","SP Holmes","RJ Kloser","RW Lee","IM Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"af5ad16601c0d66b64d7021515b5ac1c","permalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_henschke.2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_henschke.2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Salp-falls in the Tasman Sea: a major food input to deep-sea benthos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martina A Doblin","Christel S Hassler","J R Seymour","Mark E Baird","Jason D Everett","M V Brown","Katherina L Petrou","Peter J Ralph","Peter A Thompson","Iain M Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"385c28d4ab577d1a1b89763983470cae","permalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_doblin.2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_doblin.2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Shift in photosynthetic microbial assemblages and coastal biogeochemical functioning due to a strengthening western boundary current","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

In this paper, Warreen observations along the southeast Australian seaboard from 28°S to 38°S are interpreted based on synoptic meteorological and oceanographic conditions and ocean climatologies. Meteorological conditions are based on the NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis Project; oceanographic conditions use Warreen hydrological observations, and the ocean climatology is the CSIRO Atlas of Regional Seas. The Warreen observations were undertaken in waters on average 0.45°C cooler than the climatological average, and included the longest duration El Niño of the 20th century. In northern New South Wales (NSW), week time-scale events dominate zooplankton response. In August 1940 an unusual winter upwelling event occurred in northern NSW driven by a stronger than average East Australian Current (EAC) and anomalous northerly winds that resulted in high salp and larvacean abundance. In January 1941 a strong upwelling event between 28° and 33°S resulted in a filament of upwelled water being advected south and alongshore, which was low in zooplankton biovolume. In southern NSW a seasonal cycle in physical and planktonic characteristics is observed. In January 1941 the poleward extension of the EAC was strong, advecting more tropical tunicate species southward. Zooplankton abundance and distribution on the continental shelf and slope are more dependent on weekly to monthly timescales on local oceanographic and meteorological conditions than continental-scale interannual trends.

The surface water was biologically characterised by the phytoplankton biomass, composition, photo-physiology, carbon fixation and by nutrient-enrichment experiments. Marked differences in phytoplankton biomass and composition were observed. Contrasted biomarker composition suggests that biomarkers could be used to track water masses in this area. Divinyl chlorophyll a, a biomarker for tropical Prochlorophytes, was found only in the EAC. Zeaxanthin a biomarker for Cyanophytes, was found only within the oceanic eddy and in the EAC, whereas chlorophyll b (Chlorophytes) was only present in the coastal eddy and at the front between the inner-shelf and EAC waters.This study showed that cold-core eddies can affect phytoplankton, biomass, biodiversity and productivity. Inside the oceanic eddy, greater phytoplankton biomass and a more complex phytoplankton community were observed relative to adjacent water masses (including the EAC). In fact, phytoplankton communities inside the oceanic eddy more closely resembled the community observed in the inner-shelf waters. At a light level close to half-saturation, phytoplankton carbon fixation (gCd−1) in the oceanic eddy was 13-times greater than at the frontal zone between the eddy and the EAC and 3-times greater than in the inner-shelf water. Nutrient-enrichment experiments demonstrated that nitrogen was the major macronutrient limiting phytoplankton growth in water masses associated with the oceanic eddy. Although the effective quantum yield values demonstrate healthy phytoplankton communities, the phytoplankton community bloomed and shifted in response to nitrogen enrichments inside the oceanic eddy and in the frontal zone between this eddy and the EAC. An effect of Si enrichment was only observed at the frontal zone between the eddy and the EAC. No response to nutrient enrichment was observed in the inner-shelf water where ambient NOx, Si and PO4 concentrations were up to 14, 4 and 3-times greater than in the EAC and oceanic eddy. Although results from the nutrient-enrichment experiments suggest that nutrients can affect biomass and the composition of the phytoplankton community, the comparison of all sites sampled showed no direct relationship between phytoplankton biomass, nutrients and the depth of the mixed layer. This is probably due to the different timeframe between the rapidly changing physical and chemical oceanography in the separation zone of the EAC.","tags":[],"title":"Characterisation of water masses and phytoplankton nutrient limitation in the East Australian Current separation zone during spring 2008","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Henschke","JD Everett","ME Baird","MD Taylor","IM Suthers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"d5e6965bdd463097dd88a32261c4dfdb","permalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_henschke.2011/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_henschke.2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Distribution of life-history stages of the salp Thalia democratica in shelf waters during a spring bloom","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark E.

The separation zone greatly influences coastal ecosystems for the relatively narrow continental shelf (only 15–50km wide), particularly between 32–34°S. In this region the continental shelf has a marked shift in the seasonal temperature-salinity relationship and elevated surface nitrate concentrations. This current parallels the portion of the coast where Australia’s population is concentrated and has a long history of scientific research. However, understanding of physical and biological processes driven by the EAC, particularly in linking circulation to ecosystems, is limited. In this special issue of 16 papers on the EAC, we examine the effects of climatic wind-stress forced ocean dynamics on EAC transport variability and coastal sea level, from ENSO to multi-decadal time scales; eddy formation and structure; fine scale connectivity and larval retention. Comparisons with the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current on Australia’s west coast show differences in ecosystem productivity that can be attributed to the underlying physics in each region. On average there is double the chlorophyll a concentration on the east coast than the west. In comparison to the Leeuwin, the EAC may have less local retention of larvae and act as a partial barrier to onshore transport, which may also be related to the local spawning and early life history of small pelagic fish on each coast. Inter-annual variations in the EAC transport produce a detectable sea-level signal in Sydney Harbour, which could provide a useful fisheries index as does the Fremantle sea level and Leeuwin Current relationship. The EAC’s eddy structure and formation by the EAC are examined. A particular cold-core eddy is shown to have a “tilt” towards the coast, and that during a rotation the flow of particles may rise up to the euphotic zone and then down beneath. In a warm-core eddy, surface flooding is shown to produce a new shallower surface mixed layer and promote algal growth. An assessment of plankton data from 1938–1942 showed that the local, synoptic conditions had to be incorporated before any comparison with the present. There are useful relationships of water mass characteristics in the Tasman Sea and separation zone with larval fish diversity and abundance, as well as with long-line fisheries. These fisheries-pelagic habitat relationships are invaluable for fisheries management, as well as for climate change assessments.There is further need to examine the EAC influence on rainfall, storm activity, dust deposition, and on the movements by fish, sharks and whales. The Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) has provided new infrastructure to determine the changing behaviour of the EAC and its bio-physical interaction with the coasts and estuaries. The forecasting and hindcasting capability developed under the Bluelink project has provided a new tool for data synthesis and dynamical analysis. The impact of a strengthening EAC and how it influences the livelihoods of over half the Australian population, from Brisbane to Sydney, Hobart and Melbourne, is just being realised.","tags":[],"title":"The strengthening East Australian Current, its eddies and biological effects — an introduction and overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

In October 2008 a filament of upwelled water was advected south by the adjacent East Australian Current and formed a 30 km diameter cold-core eddy (CCE). The three-dimensional structure of a subsurface swarm of T. democratica within the eddy was examined using both oblique and vertical hauls and an optical plankton counter (OPC) deployed on a towed body. The CCE displayed distinct uplift of the nutricline and elevated fluorescence. Net samples show the zooplankton community was dominated by T. democratica, comprising 73\\%–88\\% of zooplankton abundance. The size distribution of T. democratica measured from net samples was 0.5–5 mm and was used to interpret the OPC transects, which showed the swarm formed a 15 km diameter disc located 20–40 m deep in the center of the eddy. The maximum salp abundance was in the pycnocline and coincided with the subsurface fluorescence maximum. The mean abundance of T. democratica size particles within the disc was 5003 individuals m−3 (ind. m−3), contrasted with only 604 ind. m−3 at the outer edge of the eddy. The vertically concentrated and horizontally constrained disc-shaped salp swarm occurred at the interface of salp-bearing inner shelf water and nutrient-rich upwelled water in a CCE. The physical processes that formed the CCE on the inshore edge of the western boundary current led to the largest density of salps recorded.","tags":[],"title":"Three‐dimensional structure of a swarm of the salp Thalia democratica within a cold‐core eddy off southeast Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason D.

ICOLLs are characterised by low flow from the catchment and a dynamic sand bar blocking oceanic exchange, which creates two distinct phases – open and closed. The process descriptions in the ecological model are based on a combination of physical and physiological limits to the processes of nutrient uptake, light capture by phytoplankton and predator–prey interactions. An inverse model is used to calculate mixing coefficients from salinity observations. When compared to field data, the ecological model obtains a fit for salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a and zooplankton which is within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean of the field data. Simulations show that nutrient limitation (nitrogen and phosphorus) is the dominant factor limiting growth of the autotrophic state variables during both the open and closed phases of the lake. The model is characterised by strong oscillations in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, typical of predator–prey cycles. There is an increase in the productivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton during the open phase. This increased productivity is exported out of the lagoon with a net nitrogen export from water column variables of 489 and 2012molNd−1 during the two studied openings. The model is found to be most sensitive to the mortality and feeding efficiency of zooplankton.","tags":[],"title":"Nutrient and plankton dynamics in an intermittently closed/open lagoon, Smiths Lake, south-eastern Australia: An ecological model","type":"publication"}]
