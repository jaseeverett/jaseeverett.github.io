      <description>&lt;p&gt;Body size has been described as the ‘master trait’, setting the pace of life by dictating processes such as metabolism, respiration, development, movement, and constraining the role of an individual in its food web. In this project, we are collating thousands of observations of zooplankton size, from all over the world, in order to reveal ecological rates and processes not readily apparent from conventional taxonomic methods. This relationship between organism size and vital rates is strongest in plankton systems, where nutrient and light limitation, grazing encounters, and the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels are all size dependent&lt;/p&gt;
