Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I work on understanding how oceanographic processes structure global pelagic food webs, designing climate-smart marine protected areas and investigating the impact of climate-change on marine ecosystem function. I enjoy working with model output, including oceanographic, climate and size-spectra, and collating large observational datasets to analyse.\nRecently I have been building R-packages and R-shiny visualisation tools and applying novel spatial planning methods to inform marine spatial management. I am currently working on tools for on-the-ground deployment in the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) and various island nations of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\nFind out more about my Research, and the Tools we have released on these pages.\nCurrently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow in the Mathematical Marine Ecology Research Laboratory at The University of Queensland and a Visting Scientist at The University of New South Wales and CSIRO Environment\nGet in touch."

In this project, we are collating thousands of observations of zooplankton size, from all over the world, in order to reveal ecological rates and processes not readily apparent from conventional taxonomic methods. This relationship between organism size and vital rates is strongest in plankton systems, where nutrient and light limitation, grazing encounters, and the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels are all size dependent"

To mitigate impacts of these threats on biodiversity, marine protected areas – national parks in the ocean – are being created. As there is a global push to increase the marine protected area network coverage from 8% to potentially 20% or even 30% in the next decade, developing the science to underpin where to place these reserves is critical and timely.\nA current focus of our research is thus how to design robust climate-smart marine protected areas that conserve biodiversity, protect against climate change, retain biodiversity as the climate warms, ensure connectivity, minimise conflict with fishing, whilst considering the 3-D nature of the ocean. This is a tough task! It requires extensive computational expertise and infrastructure. Our work involves mapping global biodiversity and developing new approaches to the design of climate-smart marine protected area networks using state-of-the-art statistical and computational approaches on super-computers."
