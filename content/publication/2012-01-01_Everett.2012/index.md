abstract: The Tasman Sea is unique - characterised by a strong seasonal western boundary
  current that breaks down into a complicated field of mesoscale eddies almost immediately
  after separating from the coast. Through a 16-year analysis of Tasman Sea eddies,
  we identify a region along the southeast Australian coast which we name ‘Eddy Avenue’
  where eddies have higher sea level anomalies, faster rotation and greater sea surface
  temperature and chlorophylla anomalies. The density of cyclonic and anticyclonic
  eddies within Eddy Avenue is 23\% and 16\% higher respectively than the broader
  Tasman Sea. We find that Eddy Avenue cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies have more
  strongly differentiated biological properties than those of the broader Tasman Sea,
  as a result of larger anticyclonic eddies formed from Coral Sea water depressing
  chl. aconcentrations, and for coastal cyclonic eddies due to the entrainment of
  nutrient-rich shelf waters. Cyclonic eddies within Eddy Avenue have almost double
  the chlorophylla (0.35 mg m−3) of anticyclonic eddies (0.18 mg m−3). The average
  chlorophyll a concentration for cyclonic eddies is 16\% higher in Eddy Avenue and
  28\% lower for anticyclonic eddies when compared to the Tasman Sea. With a strengthening
  East Australian Current, the propagation of these eddies will have significant implications
  for heat transport and the entrainment and connectivity of plankton and larval fish
  populations.
