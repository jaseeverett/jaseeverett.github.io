abstract: Mesozooplankton (June 2015 and September 2017) and micronekton (September
  2017) were sampled along the eastern coast of Australia. Depth stratified mesozooplankton
  and micronekton were collected using a Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental
  Sensing System (MOCNESS) and an International Young Gadoid Pelagic Trawl (IYGPT)
  equipped with an opening/closing codend. Sampling was undertaken at the center and
  edge of a frontal cold-core eddy (F-CCE Center and Edge) in 2015, and at the center
  of a cold-core eddy (B-CCE) and two warm-core eddies (R-WCE and WCE) in 2017. We
  assess the diel vertical structure, biomass, and downward active carbon transport
  by mesozooplankton and micronekton in eddies. Total water column mesozooplankton
  and micronekton biomass did not vary substantially across water masses, while the
  extent and depth of diel vertical migration did. Using in situ measurements of temperature
  and measurements of mesozooplankton and micronekton abundance and biomass, we estimated
  the contribution of respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion, gut flux,
  and mortality to total downward active carbon transport in each water mass. Overall,
  active carbon transport by mesozooplankton and micronekton below the mixed layer
  varied substantially across water masses. We corrected estimates of micronekton
  migratory biomass and active carbon transport assuming 50\% net efficiency. In the
  R-WCE mesozooplankton remained within the mixed layer during the day and night;
  only 50\% of the total micronekton population migrated below the mixed layer contributing
  to carbon transport, equating to 2.89 mg C m–2 d–1. Mesozooplankton actively transported
  16.1 and 8.0 mg C m–2 d–1 at the F-CCE Center and Edge, respectively. Mesozooplankton
  and micronekton active carbon transport in the B-CCE were 5.4 and 0.74 mg C m–2
  d–1, and in the WCE 88 and 13.4 mg C m–2 d–1. Differences in carbon export were
  dependent on food availability, temperature, time spent migrating, and mixed layer
  depth. These findings suggest that under certain conditions mesoscale eddies can
  act as important carbon sinks.
