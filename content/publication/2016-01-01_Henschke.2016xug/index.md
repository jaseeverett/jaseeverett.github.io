abstract: Salps are barrel-shaped, gelatinous zooplankton that regularly form large
  swarms. They have historically been ignored because they are difficult to sample
  and their gelatinous body structure suggests that they are unimportant in food webs
  and biogeochemical cycles. We collate evidence to overturn several common misconceptions
  about salps that have hampered research. We show that salps play a major role in
  carbon sequestration and are key components of marine food webs as a food source
  for at least 202 species including fish, turtles, and crustaceans. The future of
  salps in the Anthropocene is uncertain, and therefore further research into areas
  such as basic rate processes and their biogeochemical impact through new and innovative
  laboratory and field methods is needed.
