abstract: This study focuses on the comparison of oceanic and coastal cold-core eddies
  with inner-shelf and East Australian Current (EAC) waters at the time of the spring
  bloom (October 2008). The surface water was biologically characterised by the phytoplankton
  biomass, composition, photo-physiology, carbon fixation and by nutrient-enrichment
  experiments. Marked differences in phytoplankton biomass and composition were observed.
  Contrasted biomarker composition suggests that biomarkers could be used to track
  water masses in this area. Divinyl chlorophyll a, a biomarker for tropical Prochlorophytes,
  was found only in the EAC. Zeaxanthin a biomarker for Cyanophytes, was found only
  within the oceanic eddy and in the EAC, whereas chlorophyll b (Chlorophytes) was
  only present in the coastal eddy and at the front between the inner-shelf and EAC
  waters.This study showed that cold-core eddies can affect phytoplankton, biomass,
  biodiversity and productivity. Inside the oceanic eddy, greater phytoplankton biomass
  and a more complex phytoplankton community were observed relative to adjacent water
  masses (including the EAC). In fact, phytoplankton communities inside the oceanic
  eddy more closely resembled the community observed in the inner-shelf waters. At
  a light level close to half-saturation, phytoplankton carbon fixation (gCdâˆ’1) in
  the oceanic eddy was 13-times greater than at the frontal zone between the eddy
  and the EAC and 3-times greater than in the inner-shelf water. Nutrient-enrichment
  experiments demonstrated that nitrogen was the major macronutrient limiting phytoplankton
  growth in water masses associated with the oceanic eddy. Although the effective
  quantum yield values demonstrate healthy phytoplankton communities, the phytoplankton
  community bloomed and shifted in response to nitrogen enrichments inside the oceanic
  eddy and in the frontal zone between this eddy and the EAC. An effect of Si enrichment
  was only observed at the frontal zone between the eddy and the EAC. No response
  to nutrient enrichment was observed in the inner-shelf water where ambient NOx,
  Si and PO4 concentrations were up to 14, 4 and 3-times greater than in the EAC and
  oceanic eddy. Although results from the nutrient-enrichment experiments suggest
  that nutrients can affect biomass and the composition of the phytoplankton community,
  the comparison of all sites sampled showed no direct relationship between phytoplankton
  biomass, nutrients and the depth of the mixed layer. This is probably due to the
  different timeframe between the rapidly changing physical and chemical oceanography
  in the separation zone of the EAC.
