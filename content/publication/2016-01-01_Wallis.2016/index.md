abstract: Sea ice is an influential feature in Southern Ocean-Antarctic marine environments
  creating a 2-phase vertical ecosystem. The lack of information on how this system
  influences community structure during the winter-spring transition, however, is
  largely lacking. Zooplankton form the link that bridges these environments, with
  the meiofaunal and algal communities within sea ice directly influencing the epipelagic
  zooplankton community at the ice-water interface. A combination of methods including
  sea-ice coring, umbrella net sampling and Laser Optical Plankton Counter were used
  to describe the vertical structure of zooplankton and meiofaunal communities. The
  distribution of meiofauna and chlorophyll a both played important roles in structuring
  the zooplankton community within this dynamic region. Many dominant taxa, including
  Calanus propinquus and Oithona similis, directly responded to the high availability
  of algae present within the bottom strata of sea ice. The sea-ice associated species
  Stephos longipes represented a strong link between this 2-phase ecosystem. Observations
  of the vertical distribution of biomass obtained from the LOPC suggests that the
  responses of these species to the sea ice directly influences the vertical structure
  of zooplankton during the winter-spring transition.
