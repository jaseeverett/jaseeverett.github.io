abstract: Transport of larvae by ocean currents is an important dispersal mechanism
  for many species. The timing and location of spawning can have a large influence
  on settlement location. Shifts in the known spawning habitat of fish, whether due
  to climate or the discovery of new spawning stock, can influence the distribution
  of juveniles and our understanding of connectivity. The globally distributed species;
  Pomatomus saltatrix, is one such example where a previously unrecognised summer
  spawning event and a more southern latitudinal extent was recently reported for
  the southwest Pacific population. Although restrictions are in place to protect
  the traditional spawning event, the importance of the newly recognised summer spawning
  event is uncertain. Here, we investigate larval dispersal of P. saltatrix using
  particle tracking simulations to identify the contributions of the different spawning
  events to settlement. By modelling dispersal of larvae released in northern and
  mid‐latitude regions over the Austral spring and summer, we show that the newly
  recognised mid‐latitude summer spawning event contributes over 50\% of the larvae
  reaching southern latitudes. This is due to a reduced (1–2 days) pelagic larval
  duration (associated with temperature), resulting in reduced larval mortality, and
  the seasonal (summer) strengthening of the East Australian Current (EAC) transporting
  particles \textbackslashtextasciitilde50 km further south. These findings demonstrate
  that in dynamic boundary current systems such as the EAC, the final settlement location
  of larvae that are transported by ocean currents can vary considerably depending
  on the timing and location of spawning and that multiple spawning events are important
  for maximum dispersal.
