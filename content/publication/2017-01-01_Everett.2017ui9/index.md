abstract: 'Zooplankton are the intermediate trophic level between phytoplankton and
  fish, and are an important component of carbon and nutrient cycles, accounting for
  a large proportion of the energy transfer to pelagic fishes and the deep ocean.
  Given zooplankton''s importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton
  dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try
  and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by filling three gaps. The
  first is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical,
  ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional
  groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton.
  The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are
  available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so
  we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses
  for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations
  provides the necessary context to address the last gapâ€”a blueprint for model assessment
  of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations
  can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be
  more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs
  to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment
  of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.'
