abstract: The intensification of western boundary currents in the global ocean will
  potentially influence meso-scale eddy generation, and redistribute microbes and
  their associated ecological and biogeochemical functions. To understand eddy-induced
  changes in microbial community composition as well as how they control growth, we
  targeted the East Australian Current (EAC) region to sample microbes in a cyclonic
  (cold-core) eddy (CCE) and the adjacent EAC. Phototrophic and diazotrophic microbes
  were more diverse (2–10 times greater Shannon index) in the CCE relative to the
  EAC, and the cell size distribution in the CCE was dominated (67\%) by larger micro-plankton
  ≥ 20 μ m , as opposed to pico- and nano-sized cells in the EAC. Nutrient addition
  experiments determined that nitrogen was the principal nutrient limiting growth
  in the EAC, while iron was a secondary limiting nutrient in the CCE. Among the diazotrophic
  community, heterotrophic NifH gene sequences dominated in the EAC and were attributable
  to members of the gamma-, beta-, and delta-proteobacteria, while the CCE contained
  both phototrophic and heterotrophic diazotrophs, including Trichodesmium, UCYN-A
  and gamma-proteobacteria. Daily sampling of incubation bottles following nutrient
  amendment captured a cascade of effects at the cellular, population and community
  level, indicating taxon-specific differences in the speed of response of microbes
  to nutrient supply. Nitrogen addition to the CCE community increased picoeukaryote
  chlorophyll a quotas within 24 h, suggesting that nutrient uplift by eddies causes
  a ‘greening’ effect as well as an increase in phytoplankton biomass. After three
  days in both the EAC and CCE, diatoms increased in abundance with macronutrient
  (N, P, Si) and iron amendment, whereas haptophytes and phototrophic dinoflagellates
  declined. Our results indicate that cyclonic eddies increase delivery of nitrogen
  to the upper ocean to potentially mitigate the negative consequences of increased
  stratification due to ocean warming, but also increase the biological demand for
  iron that is necessary to sustain the growth of large-celled phototrophs and potentially
  support the diversity of diazotrophs over longer time-scales.
