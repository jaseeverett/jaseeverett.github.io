abstract: Some dramatic consequences of climate change are caused by shifting species
  interactions and associated changes to trophic structure and energy flow. In coastal
  ecosystems, the relative abundance of feeding guilds indicates dominant energy sources
  sustaining food webs. Here, we use a space‐for‐time substitution to investigate
  potential climate change impacts on trophic structure and energy flow in reef fish
  communities. We investigated latitudinal and seasonal patterns in the biomass distribution
  of five trophic groups across subtropical to temperate latitudes (29 to 44°S) in
  eastern Australia. Along western boundary currents, temperatures are increasing
  up to three times faster than the global average, making them ideal for studying
  climate change impacts. Using 10 years of Reef Life Survey data, we investigated
  potential determinants of fish biomass and community composition with generalized
  additive mixed models. Biomass decreased towards higher latitudes, from 220 g/m2
  in the subtropics to 13 g/m2 in the south. Dominant trophic group also changed latitudinally,
  with herbivores and omnivores dominating lower latitudes (\textbackslashtextasciitilde30°S),
  zooplanktivores at mid‐latitudes (\textbackslashtextasciitilde35°S) and benthic
  invertivores at higher latitudes (\textbackslashtextasciitilde40°S). Biomass varied
  seasonally, with lower latitudes experiencing a 3.2‐fold increase between spring
  and autumn, while variation at higher latitudes was 1.9‐fold. We found strong evidence
  that factors linked to latitude and seasonality are important determinants in the
  distribution of fish trophic structure. As climate‐driven species redistributions
  accelerate in the 21st century, expected poleward shifts in trophic structure include
  overall increases in fish biomass linked to enhanced herbivory at mid‐latitudes
  and increased planktivory at higher latitudes.
