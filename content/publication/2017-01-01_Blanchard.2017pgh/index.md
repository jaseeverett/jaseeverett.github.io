abstract: Size-based ecosystem modeling is emerging as a powerful way to assess ecosystem-level
  impacts of human-and environment-driven changes from individual-level processes.
  These models have evolved as mechanistic explanations for observed regular patterns
  of abundance across the marine size spectrum hypothesized to hold from bacteria
  to whales. Fifty years since the first size spectrum measurements, we ask how far
  have we come? ...
