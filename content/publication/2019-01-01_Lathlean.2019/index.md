abstract: Recent debates have arisen as to whether productivity and subsequent ecological
  processes increase linearly with increasing intensity of upwelling, or whether productivity
  responds more favourably to upwelling of intermediate magnitude, as predicted by
  the intermittent upwelling hypothesis (IUH). Most studies on the topic take place
  within eastern boundary systems, where the intensity and frequency of upwelling
  are high. Here, we test the generality of the IUH towards the other end of the upwelling
  spectrum, within two regions located at similar latitudes along western boundary
  currents of two continents. We measured barnacle recruitment and colonisation, which
  we expected to be linked positively to productivity, across eight rocky shores along
  the east coasts of South Africa and Australia selected to capture a range of upwelling
  regimes. Based on Bakun Upwelling Indices (BUI), the four South African sites experienced
  persistent to intermittent levels of upwelling, whilst the four sites along the
  east coast of Australia were predominantly downwelling sites with occasional upwelling
  events. Satellite chlorophyll a concentrations ([Chl-a]) also showed a marked difference
  between the two continents, with 2â€“3 times higher concentrations in South Africa
  than Australia. In situ sea temperature measurements revealed slightly different
  oceanographic patterns, which were nonetheless compatible with both BUI and [Chl-a]
  measurements. Barnacle recruitment was typically greater within South Africa and
  but was generally found to vary unimodally with mean BUI (i.e. being greater at
  sites that experienced moderate upwelling conditions) and to increase linearly with
  increasing upwelling frequency between January and April when barnacle larvae are
  known to be most abundant in the water column. Viewed in isolation, our data provide
  moderate support for the IUH. But when placed in a broader context, with our eight
  study locations representing just one end of the upwelling continuum, they provide
  strong evidence for the IUH.
