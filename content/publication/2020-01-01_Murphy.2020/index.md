abstract: 'Individual body size strongly influences the trophic role of marine organisms
  and the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Quantifying trophic position–individual
  body size relationships (trophic allometries) underpins the development of size‐structured
  ecosystem models to predict abundance and the transfer of energy through ecosystems.
  Trophic allometries are well studied for fishes but remain relatively unexplored
  for cephalopods. Cephalopods are important components of coastal, oceanic and deep‐sea
  ecosystems, and they play a key role in the transfer of biomass from low trophic
  positions to higher predators. It is therefore important to resolve cephalopod trophic
  allometries to accurately represent them within size‐structured ecosystem models.
  We assessed the trophic positions of cephalopods in an oceanic pelagic (0–500 m)
  community (sampled by trawling in a cold‐core eddy in the western Tasman Sea), comprising
  22 species from 12 families, using bulk tissue stable isotope analysis and amino
  acid compound‐specific stable isotope analysis. We assessed whether ontogenetic
  trophic position shifts were evident at the species‐level and tested for the best
  predictor of community‐level trophic allometry among body size, taxonomy and functional
  grouping (informed by fin and mantle morphology). Individuals in this cephalopod
  community spanned two trophic positions and fell into three functional groups on
  an activity level gradient: low, medium and high. The relationship between trophic
  position and ontogeny varied among species, with the most marked differences evident
  between species from different functional groups. Activity‐level‐based functional
  group and individual body size are best explained by cephalopod trophic positions
  (marginal R2 = 0.43). Our results suggest that the morphological traits used to
  infer activity level, such as fin‐to‐mantle length ratio, fin musculature and mantle
  musculature are strong predictors of cephalopod trophic allometries. Contrary to
  established theory, not all cephalopods are voracious predators. Low activity level
  cephalopods have a distinct feeding mode, with low trophic positions and little‐to‐no
  ontogenetic increases. Given the important role of cephalopods in marine ecosystems,
  distinct feeding modes could have important consequences for energy pathways and
  ecosystem structure and function. These findings will facilitate trait‐based and
  other model estimates of cephalopod abundance in the changing global ocean. The
  authors found that oceanic cephalopods have distinct trophic roles, which are explained
  by body size and activity level. This insight will improve our capacity to understand
  the structure and function of marine ecosystems.'
