abstract: Since 2008, 26 glider missions have been undertaken along the continental
  shelf of southeastern Australia. Typically these missions have spanned the continental
  shelf on the inshore edge of the East Australian Current from 29.5-33.5Â°S. This
  comprehensive dataset of over 33,600 CTD profiles from the surface to within 10
  m of the bottom in water depths ranging 25-200 m provides new and unprecedented
  high resolution observations of the properties of the continental shelf waters adjacent
  to a western boundary current, straddling the region where it separates from the
  coast. The region is both physically and biologically significant, and is also in
  a hotspot of ocean warming. We present gridded mean fields for temperature, salinity
  and density, but also dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a fluorescence indicative
  of phytoplankton biomass. This data will be invaluable for understanding shelf stratification,
  circulation, biophysical and bio-geochemical interactions, as well as for the validation
  of high-resolution ocean models or serving as teaching material.
