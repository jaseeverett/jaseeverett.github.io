abstract: The poleward flowing East Australian Current (EAC) is characterised by its
  separation from the coast, 100–200 nautical miles north of Sydney, to form the eastward
  flowing Tasman Front and a southward flowing eddy field. The separation zone greatly
  influences coastal ecosystems for the relatively narrow continental shelf (only
  15–50km wide), particularly between 32–34°S. In this region the continental shelf
  has a marked shift in the seasonal temperature-salinity relationship and elevated
  surface nitrate concentrations. This current parallels the portion of the coast
  where Australia’s population is concentrated and has a long history of scientific
  research. However, understanding of physical and biological processes driven by
  the EAC, particularly in linking circulation to ecosystems, is limited. In this
  special issue of 16 papers on the EAC, we examine the effects of climatic wind-stress
  forced ocean dynamics on EAC transport variability and coastal sea level, from ENSO
  to multi-decadal time scales; eddy formation and structure; fine scale connectivity
  and larval retention. Comparisons with the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current on Australia’s
  west coast show differences in ecosystem productivity that can be attributed to
  the underlying physics in each region. On average there is double the chlorophyll
  a concentration on the east coast than the west. In comparison to the Leeuwin, the
  EAC may have less local retention of larvae and act as a partial barrier to onshore
  transport, which may also be related to the local spawning and early life history
  of small pelagic fish on each coast. Inter-annual variations in the EAC transport
  produce a detectable sea-level signal in Sydney Harbour, which could provide a useful
  fisheries index as does the Fremantle sea level and Leeuwin Current relationship.
  The EAC’s eddy structure and formation by the EAC are examined. A particular cold-core
  eddy is shown to have a “tilt” towards the coast, and that during a rotation the
  flow of particles may rise up to the euphotic zone and then down beneath. In a warm-core
  eddy, surface flooding is shown to produce a new shallower surface mixed layer and
  promote algal growth. An assessment of plankton data from 1938–1942 showed that
  the local, synoptic conditions had to be incorporated before any comparison with
  the present. There are useful relationships of water mass characteristics in the
  Tasman Sea and separation zone with larval fish diversity and abundance, as well
  as with long-line fisheries. These fisheries-pelagic habitat relationships are invaluable
  for fisheries management, as well as for climate change assessments.There is further
  need to examine the EAC influence on rainfall, storm activity, dust deposition,
  and on the movements by fish, sharks and whales. The Australian Integrated Marine
  Observing System (IMOS) has provided new infrastructure to determine the changing
  behaviour of the EAC and its bio-physical interaction with the coasts and estuaries.
  The forecasting and hindcasting capability developed under the Bluelink project
  has provided a new tool for data synthesis and dynamical analysis. The impact of
  a strengthening EAC and how it influences the livelihoods of over half the Australian
  population, from Brisbane to Sydney, Hobart and Melbourne, is just being realised.
