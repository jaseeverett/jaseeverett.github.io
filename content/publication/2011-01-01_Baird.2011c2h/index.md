abstract: Warm-core eddies (WCEs) formed from the East Australian Current (EAC) play
  an important role in the heat, mass and biogeochemical budgets of the western Tasman
  Sea. The development and separation of an EAC WCE during July–December 2008 was
  observed using remotely sensed temperature, ocean colour and sea-level elevation,
  three Argo floats, a shipboard CTD, a shelf mooring array and a 15-day deployment
  of a Slocum glider. The eddy formed from an EAC meander during the first half of
  2008 and in late August had a ∼275m deep surface mixed layer. In the two months
  before separation in early December, fresher and warmer EAC water flooded the top
  of the eddy, submerging the winter mixed layer. The rate of vertical transport due
  to submergence was estimated to be between 1 and 6Sv, at the time accounting for
  a significant fraction of the mean southward flow of the EAC. The core of the eddy
  had a surface chlorophyll a concentration of <0.4mgm−3 throughout the observations.
  A 20–40m thick pycnocline formed at the interface of the flooding surface waters
  and the submerged layer. Chlorophyll a concentration in the pycnocline ranged from
  0.5 to 2mgm−3, with depth-integrated concentration ranging between 25 and 75mgm−2.
  The development of a sub-surface maximum suggests that flooding increased light
  levels in the pycnocline. Elevated levels of coloured dissolved organic matter in
  the submerged layer correspond to oxygen depletion, suggesting respiration of organic
  matter. A comparison is made with observations from WCEs in 1978 and 1997 in which,
  unusually, surface flooding did not occur, but solar heating stratified the top
  50m. In the two eddies with surface capping, surface chlorophyll a concentrations
  were an order of magnitude higher than the 2008 flooded eddy, but depth-integrated
  chlorophyll a was similar. These findings suggest that EAC WCEs with relatively
  shallow surface flooding contain more phytoplankton biomass than surface images
  would suggest, with the vertical position of the chlorophyll a maximum depending
  on whether, and to what depth, the winter surface mixed layer is submerged.
