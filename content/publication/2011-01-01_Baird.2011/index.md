abstract: The research vessel Warreen obtained 1742 planktonic samples along the continental
  shelf and slope of southeast Australia from 1938–42, representing the earliest spatially
  and temporally resolved zooplankton data from Australian marine waters. In this
  paper, Warreen observations along the southeast Australian seaboard from 28°S to
  38°S are interpreted based on synoptic meteorological and oceanographic conditions
  and ocean climatologies. Meteorological conditions are based on the NOAA-CIRES 20th
  Century Reanalysis Project; oceanographic conditions use Warreen hydrological observations,
  and the ocean climatology is the CSIRO Atlas of Regional Seas. The Warreen observations
  were undertaken in waters on average 0.45°C cooler than the climatological average,
  and included the longest duration El Niño of the 20th century. In northern New South
  Wales (NSW), week time-scale events dominate zooplankton response. In August 1940
  an unusual winter upwelling event occurred in northern NSW driven by a stronger
  than average East Australian Current (EAC) and anomalous northerly winds that resulted
  in high salp and larvacean abundance. In January 1941 a strong upwelling event between
  28° and 33°S resulted in a filament of upwelled water being advected south and alongshore,
  which was low in zooplankton biovolume. In southern NSW a seasonal cycle in physical
  and planktonic characteristics is observed. In January 1941 the poleward extension
  of the EAC was strong, advecting more tropical tunicate species southward. Zooplankton
  abundance and distribution on the continental shelf and slope are more dependent
  on weekly to monthly timescales on local oceanographic and meteorological conditions
  than continental-scale interannual trends. The interpretation of historical zooplankton
  observations of the waters off southeast Australia for the purpose of quantifying
  anthropogenic impacts will be improved with the use of regional hindcasts of synoptic
  ocean and atmospheric weather that can explain some of the physically forced natural
  variability.
