abstract: Swarms of the pelagic tunicate, Thalia democratica, form during spring,
  but the causes of the large interannual variability in the magnitude of salp swarms
  are unclear. Changes in asexual reproduction (buds per chain) of T. democratica
  populations in the coastal waters of south-east Australia (32–35°S) were observed
  in three austral springs (October 2008–2010). T. democratica abundance was significantly
  higher in 2008 (1,312 individuals m−3) than 2009 and 2010 (210 and 92 individuals
  m−3, respectively). There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression,
  r2 = 0.61, F1,22 = 33.83, P < 0.001) between abundance and asexual reproduction.
  Similarly, relative growth rates declined with decreasing abundance. Generalised
  additive mixed modelling showed that T. democratica abundance was significantly
  positively related to preferred food >2 μm in size (P < 0.05) and negatively related
  to the proportion of non-salp zooplankton (P < 0.001). Salp swarm magnitude, growth,
  and asexual reproduction may depend on the abundance of larger phytoplankton (prymnesiophytes
  and diatoms) and competition with other zooplankton.
