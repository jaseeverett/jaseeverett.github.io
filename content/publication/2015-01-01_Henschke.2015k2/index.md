abstract: 'The trophic relationships of 21 species from an oceanic zooplankton community
  were studied using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Zooplankton and suspended
  particulate organic matter (POM) were sampled in three different water types in
  the western Tasman Sea: inner shelf (IS), a cold core eddy (CCE) and a warm core
  eddy (WCE). δ15N values ranged from 3.9‰ for the parasitic copepod Sapphirina augusta
  to 10.2‰ for the euphausiid, Euphausia spinifera. δ13C varied from −22.6 to −19.4‰
  as a result of the copepod Euchirella curticauda and E. spinifera. The isotopic
  composition of POM varied significantly among water types; as did the trophic enrichment
  of zooplankton over POM, with the lowest enrichment in the recently upwelled IS
  water type (0.5‰) compared to the warm core eddy (1.6‰) and cold core eddy (2.7‰).
  The WCE was an oligotrophic environment and was associated with an increased trophic
  level for omnivorous zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids) to a similar level as
  carnivorous zooplankton (chaetognaths). Therefore carnivory in zooplankton can increase
  in response to lower abundance and reduced diversity in their phytoplankton and
  protozoan prey. Trophic niche width comparisons across three zooplankton species:
  the salp Thalia democratica, the copepod Eucalanus elongatus and the euphausiid
  Thysanoessa gregaria, indicated that both niche partitioning and competition can
  occur within the zooplankton community. We have shown that trophic relationships
  among the zooplankton are dynamic and respond to different water types. The changes
  to the zooplankton isotopic niche, however, were still highly variable as result
  of oceanographic variation within water types.'
