abstract: Large oceanic salps are rarely encountered. The highest recorded biomasses
  of the salps Thetys vagina (852 g WW m−3) and Cyclosalpa affinis (1149 g WW m−3)
  were observed in the Tasman Sea during January 2009. Due to their fast sinking rates
  the carcasses and faecal pellets of these and other large salps play a significant
  role in carbon transport to the seafloor. We calculated that faecal pellets from
  these swarms could have contributed up to 67 \% of the mean organic daily carbon
  flux in the area. This suggests that the flux of carbon from salp swarms are not
  accurately captured in current estimates. This study contributes information on
  salp abundance and biomass to a relatively understudied field, improving estimates
  for biogeochemical cycles.
