abstract: The small salp, Thalia democratica, is known globally to form dense swarms,
  yet the physiological and oceanographic factors that influence the magnitude and
  occurrence of these swarms are poorly understood. In this study, two numerical models
  were used to explore T. democratica population dynamics. A Lefkovitch matrix model
  identified that the survival of juvenile oozoids was the most important population
  metric promoting population growth and a size-structured population model was developed
  to further explore the dynamics of T. democratica. The size-structured model tracks
  cohorts of four life stages and incorporates size-dependent reproduction and mortality.
  Model outputs of average generation time and mean abundances of each life stage
  corresponded well to previously reported values. Factors that promote juvenile oozoid
  abundance were the most sensitive parameters influencing salp abundance. A 10-year
  time-series simulation using this population model identified that salp abundances
  in the Tasman Sea are proportionally higher in winter and spring, consistent with
  previous studies. This model shows that temperature and phytoplankton concentration
  are sufficient drivers of large-scale patterns of salp abundance across season and
  latitude. These results demonstrate the importance of future research focusing on
  identifying the environmental conditions that influence the size at which females
  reproduce.
