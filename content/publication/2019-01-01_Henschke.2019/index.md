abstract: Pyrosomes are efficient grazers that can form dense aggregations. Their
  clearance rates are among the highest of any zooplankton grazer, and they can rapidly
  repackage what they consume into thousands of fecal pellets per hour. In recent
  years, pyrosome swarms have been found outside of their natural geographical range;
  however, environmental drivers that promote these swarms are still unknown. During
  the austral spring of 2017 a Pyrosoma atlanticum swarm was sampled in the Tasman
  Sea. Depth‐stratified sampling during the day and night was used to examine the
  spatial and vertical distribution of P. atlanticum across three eddies. Respiration
  rate experiments were performed onboard to determine minimum feeding requirements
  for the pyrosome population. P. atlanticum was 2 orders of magnitude more abundant
  in the cold core eddy (CCE) compared to both warm core eddies, with maximum biomass
  of 360 mg WW·m−3, most likely driven by high chlorophyll a concentrations. P. atlanticum
  exhibited diel vertical migration and migrated to a maximum depth strata of 800–1,000
  m. Active carbon transport in the CCE was 4 orders of magnitude higher than the
  warm core eddies. Fecal pellet production contributed to the majority (91\%) of
  transport, and total downward carbon flux below the mixed layer was estimated at
  11 mg C·m−2·d−1. When abundant, P. atlanticum swarms have the potential to play
  a major role in active carbon transport, comparable to fluxes for zooplankton and
  micronekton communities. Pyrosomes are a gelatinous zooplankton that can form large
  swarms. They feed through filtration and are among the most efficient filter feeders
  of any zooplankton, repackaging what they consume into thousands of fecal pellets
  per hour. As pyrosomes migrate vertically to 800 m daily, they have the potential
  to transport the carbon they consume at the surface to these depths. In the austral
  spring of 2017 we sampled a pyrosome swarm in the Tasman Sea. Maximum biomass of
  pyrosomes was 360 mg WW·m−3, and pyrosomes were able to consume the majority (95\%)
  of the phytoplankton community while at the surface. When migrating below the surface,
  they transported 11 mg C·m−2·d−1 below the mixed layer, mostly through fecal pellets
  (91\%). This flux is within the range of fluxes produced by zooplankton and micronekton
  communities. A Pyrosoma atlanticum swarm was observed in a cold‐core eddy of the
  Tasman Sea where there was an increased proportion of favorable food The P. atlanticum
  population feeding at the surface consumed 95\% of the local phytoplankton standing
  stock in one night Total downward carbon flux produced by the migrating P. atlanticum
  swarm was 11 mg C·m−2·d−1
