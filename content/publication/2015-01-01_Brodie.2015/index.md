abstract: Defining the oceanic habitats of migratory marine species is important for
  both single species and ecosystem-based fisheries management, particularly when
  the distribution of these habitats vary temporally. This can be achieved using species
  distribution models that include physical environmental predictors. In the present
  study, species distribution models that describe the seasonal habitats of two pelagic
  fish (dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus and yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi),
  are developed using 19 yr of presence-only data from a recreational angler-based
  catch-and-release fishing programme. A Poisson point process model within a generalized
  additive modelling framework was used to determine the species distributions off
  the east coast of Australia as a function of several oceanographic covariates. This
  modelling framework uses presence-only data to determine the intensity of fish (fish
  kmâˆ’2), rather than a probability of fish presence. Sea surface temperature (SST),
  sea level anomaly, SST frontal index and eddy kinetic energy were significant environmental
  predictors for both dolphinfish and kingfish distributions. Models for both species
  indicate a greater fish intensity off the east Australian coast during summer and
  autumn in response to the regional oceanography, namely shelf incursions by the
  East Australian Current. This study provides a framework for using presence-only
  recreational fisheries data to create species distribution models that can contribute
  to the future dynamic spatial management of pelagic fisheries.
