abstract: The world’s oceans are undergoing rapid, regionally specific warming. Strengthening
  western boundary currents play a role in this phenomenon, with sea surface temperatures
  (SST) in their paths rising faster than the global average. To understand how dynamic
  oceanography influences food availability in these ocean warming “hotspots”, we
  use a novel prey capture signature derived from accelerometry to understand how
  the warm East Australian Current shapes foraging success by a meso-predator, the
  little penguin. This seabird feeds on low trophic level species that are sensitive
  to environmental change. We found that in 2012, prey capture success by penguins
  was high when SST was low relative to the long-term mean. In 2013 prey capture success
  was low, coincident with an unusually strong penetration of warm water. Overall
  there was an optimal temperature range for prey capture around 19–21 °C, with lower
  success at both lower and higher temperatures, mirroring published relationships
  between commercial sardine catch and SST. Spatially, higher SSTs corresponded to
  a lower probability of penguins using an area, and lower prey capture success. These
  links between high SST and reduced prey capture success by penguins suggest negative
  implications for future resource availability in a system dominated by a strengthening
  western boundary current.
