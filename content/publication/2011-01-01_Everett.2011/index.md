abstract: Swarms of the salp Thalia democratica periodically occur off southeast Australia
  following the austral spring bloom of phytoplankton. In October 2008 a filament
  of upwelled water was advected south by the adjacent East Australian Current and
  formed a 30 km diameter cold-core eddy (CCE). The three-dimensional structure of
  a subsurface swarm of T. democratica within the eddy was examined using both oblique
  and vertical hauls and an optical plankton counter (OPC) deployed on a towed body.
  The CCE displayed distinct uplift of the nutricline and elevated fluorescence. Net
  samples show the zooplankton community was dominated by T. democratica, comprising
  73\%–88\% of zooplankton abundance. The size distribution of T. democratica measured
  from net samples was 0.5–5 mm and was used to interpret the OPC transects, which
  showed the swarm formed a 15 km diameter disc located 20–40 m deep in the center
  of the eddy. The maximum salp abundance was in the pycnocline and coincided with
  the subsurface fluorescence maximum. The mean abundance of T. democratica size particles
  within the disc was 5003 individuals m−3 (ind. m−3), contrasted with only 604 ind.
  m−3 at the outer edge of the eddy. The vertically concentrated and horizontally
  constrained disc-shaped salp swarm occurred at the interface of salp-bearing inner
  shelf water and nutrient-rich upwelled water in a CCE. The physical processes that
  formed the CCE on the inshore edge of the western boundary current led to the largest
  density of salps recorded.
