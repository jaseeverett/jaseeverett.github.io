abstract: Seasonal forecasting of environmental conditions and marine species distribution
  has been used as a decision support tool in commercial and aquaculture fisheries.
  These tools may also be applicable to species targeted by the recreational fisheries
  sector, a sector that is increasing its use of marine resources, and making important
  economic and social contributions to coastal communities around the world. Here,
  a seasonal forecast of the habitat and density of dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus),
  based on sea surface temperatures, was developed for the east coast of New South
  Wales (NSW), Australia. Two prototype forecast products were created; geographic
  spatial forecasts of dolphinfish habitat and a latitudinal summary identifying the
  location of fish density peaks. The less detailed latitudinal summary was created
  to limit the resolution of habitat information to prevent potential resource over-exploitation
  by fishers in the absence of total catch controls. The forecast dolphinfish habitat
  model was accurate at the start of the annual dolphinfish migration in NSW (December)
  but other months (January - May) showed poor performance due to spatial and temporal
  variability in the catch data used in model validation. Habitat forecasts for December
  were useful up to five months ahead, with performance decreasing as forecast were
  made further into the future. The continued development and sound application of
  seasonal forecasts will help fishery industries cope with future uncertainty and
  promote dynamic and sustainable marine resource management.
