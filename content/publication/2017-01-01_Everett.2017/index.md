abstract: Patterns in larval transport of coastal species have important implications
  for species connectivity, conservation, and fisheries, especially in the vicinity
  of a strengthening boundary current. An Ocean General Circulation Model for the
  Earth Simulator particle tracking model was used to assess the potential dispersal
  of Eastern King Prawn (EKP) larvae Melicertus (Penaeus) plebejus, an important commercial
  and recreational species in Eastern Australia. Particles were exposed to a constant
  natural mortality rate, and temperature-dependent growth (degree-days) was used
  to determine the time of settlement. Forward and backward simulations were used
  to identify the extent of larval dispersal from key source locations, and to determine
  the putative spawning regions for four settlement sites. The mean dispersal distance
  for larvae was extensive (\textbackslashtextasciitilde750–1,000 km before settlement),
  yet the northern spawning locations were unlikely to contribute larvae to the most
  southern extent of the EKP range. There was generally great offshore dispersal of
  larvae, with only 2\%–5\% of larvae on the continental shelf at the time of settlement.
  Our particle tracking results were combined with existing site-specific reproductive
  potentials to identify the relative contributions of larvae from key source locations.
  Although mid-latitude sites had only moderate reproductive potential, they delivered
  the most particles to the southern coast and are probably the most important sources
  of larval EKP for the two southern estuaries. Our modelling suggests that mesoscale
  oceanography is a strong determinant of recruitment success of the EKP, and highlights
  the importance of both larval dispersal and reproductive potential for understanding
  connectivity across a species’ range.
