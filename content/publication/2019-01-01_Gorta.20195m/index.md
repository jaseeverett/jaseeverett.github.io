abstract: Many seabird communities are declining around the world, a trend frequently
  linked to climate change and human impacts on habitat and prey. Time series observations
  of seabirds away from breeding colonies are generally rare, which limits our understanding
  of long-term changes for conservation actions. We analysed a dedicated citizen science
  dataset of pelagic seabird abundance (86 species – 30 used for modelling analysis
  - from 385 trips) from two locations over 17 years (2000–2016) and a third for seven
  years, over the continental shelf and slope of south-eastern Australia. To estimate
  temporal trends and environmental drivers, we used generalised additive modelling
  and species archetype modelling for groups. Almost half (43\%) of the most abundant
  seabird species declined in our study area over the 17 years. The declines may be
  associated with human-induced ecosystem change and represent poleward shifts in
  distribution out of our study area, changes in population abundance, or both. Winter-dominant
  groups, primarily species rarely frequenting warmer water, were often negatively
  associated with SST anom , while summer-dominant groups, composed of species more
  tolerant of temperate and tropical environments, were generally positively associated
  with SST anom . Widespread local declines in seabird populations are of increasing
  concern. Understanding the extent to which these observed declines represent real
  declines in abundance, or range shifts, should be a priority. Changing sea temperatures
  are probably contributing to both. These results from the coast of south-eastern
  Australia need to be placed in the context of the highly mobile study organisms
  and the vast spatial scale of the ocean. Long-term citizen science observations,
  from an array of locations around the world, promise to provide valuable insights
  into seabird ecology, playing a key part in seabird conservation.
