abstract: Size-based ecosystem modeling is emerging as a powerful way to assess ecosystem-level
  impacts of human- and environment-driven changes from individual-level processes.
  These models have evolved as mechanistic explanations for observed regular patterns
  of abundance across the marine size spectrum hypothesized to hold from bacteria
  to whales. Fifty years since the first size spectrum measurements, we ask how far
  have we come? Although recent modeling studies capture an impressive range of sizes,
  complexity, and real-world applications, ecosystem coverage is still only partial.
  We describe how this can be overcome by unifying functional traits with size spectra
  (which we call functional size spectra) and highlight the key knowledge gaps that
  need to be filled to model ecosystems from bacteria to whales.
