abstract: 'The phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aPHY) has been suggested as a
  suitable alternate first order predictor of net primary productivity (NPP). We compiled
  a dataset of surface bio-optical properties and phytoplankton NPP measurements in
  coastal waters around Australia to examine the utility of an in-situ absorption
  model to estimate NPP. The magnitude of surface NPP (0.20–19.3 mmol C m−3 d−1) across
  sites was largely driven by phytoplankton biomass, with higher rates being attributed
  to the microplankton (>20 μm) size class. The phytoplankton absorption coefficient
  aPHY for PAR (photosynthetically active radiation; āPHY)) ranged from 0.003 to 0.073
  m-1, influenced by changes in phytoplankton community composition, physiology and
  environmental conditions. The aPHY coefficient also reflected changes in NPP and
  the absorption model-derived NPP could explain 73\% of the variability in measured
  surface NPP (n = 41; RMSE = 2.49). The absorption model was applied to two contrasting
  coastal locations to examine NPP dynamics: a high chlorophyll-high variation (HCHV;
  Port Hacking National Reference Station) and moderate chlorophyll-low variation
  (MCLV; Yongala National Reference Station) location in eastern Australia using the
  GIOP-DC satellite aPHY product. Mean daily NPP rates between 2003 and 2015 were
  higher at the HCHV site (1.71 ± 0.03 mmol C m−3 d−1) with the annual maximum NPP
  occurring during the austral winter. In contrast, the MCLV site annual NPP peak
  occurred during the austral wet season and had lower mean daily NPP (1.43 ± 0.03
  mmol C m−3 d−1) across the time-series. An absorption-based model to estimate NPP
  is a promising approach for exploring the spatio-temporal dynamics in phytoplankton
  NPP around the Australian continental shelf.'
