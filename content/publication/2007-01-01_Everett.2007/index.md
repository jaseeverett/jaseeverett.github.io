abstract: A spatially resolved, eleven-box ecological model is presented for an Intermittently
  Closed and Open Lake or Lagoon (ICOLL), configured for Smiths Lake, NSW Australia.
  ICOLLs are characterised by low flow from the catchment and a dynamic sand bar blocking
  oceanic exchange, which creates two distinct phases – open and closed. The process
  descriptions in the ecological model are based on a combination of physical and
  physiological limits to the processes of nutrient uptake, light capture by phytoplankton
  and predator–prey interactions. An inverse model is used to calculate mixing coefficients
  from salinity observations. When compared to field data, the ecological model obtains
  a fit for salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a and zooplankton which is
  within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean of the field data. Simulations show that
  nutrient limitation (nitrogen and phosphorus) is the dominant factor limiting growth
  of the autotrophic state variables during both the open and closed phases of the
  lake. The model is characterised by strong oscillations in phytoplankton and zooplankton
  abundance, typical of predator–prey cycles. There is an increase in the productivity
  of phytoplankton and zooplankton during the open phase. This increased productivity
  is exported out of the lagoon with a net nitrogen export from water column variables
  of 489 and 2012molNd−1 during the two studied openings. The model is found to be
  most sensitive to the mortality and feeding efficiency of zooplankton.
