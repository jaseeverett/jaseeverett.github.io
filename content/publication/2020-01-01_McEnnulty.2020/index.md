abstract: Abstract Zooplankton biomass data have been collected in Australian waters
  since the 1930s, yet most datasets have been unavailable to the research community.
  We have searched archives, scanned the primary and grey literature, and contacted
  researchers, to collate 49187 records of marine zooplankton biomass from waters
  around Australia (0–60°S, 110–160°E). Many of these datasets are relatively small,
  but when combined, they provide >85 years of zooplankton biomass data for Australian
  waters from 1932 to the present. Data have been standardised and all available metadata
  included. We have lodged this dataset with the Australian Ocean Data Network, allowing
  full public access. The Australian Zooplankton Biomass Database will be valuable
  for global change studies, research assessing trophic linkages, and for initialising
  and assessing biogeochemical and ecosystem models of lower trophic levels.
