abstract: 'Abstract Policy- and decision-makers require assessments of status and
  trends for marine species, habitats, and ecosystems to understand if human activities
  in the marine environment are sustainable, particularly in the face of global change.
  Central to many assessments are statistical and dynamical models of populations,
  communities, ecosystems, and their socioeconomic systems and management frameworks.
  The establishment of a national system that could facilitate the development of
  such model-based assessments has been identified as a priority for addressing management
  challenges for Australia’s marine environment. Given that most assessments require
  cross-scale information, individual models cannot capture all of the spatial, temporal,
  biological, and socioeconomic scales that are typically needed. Coupling or integrating
  models across scales and domains can expand the scope for developing comprehensive
  and internally consistent, system-level assessments, including higher-level feedbacks
  in social–ecological systems. In this article, we summarize: (i) integrated modelling
  for marine systems currently being undertaken in Australia, (ii) methods used for
  integration and comparison of models, and (iii) improvements to facilitate further
  integration, particularly with respect to standards and specifications. We consider
  future needs for integrated modelling of marine social–ecological systems in Australia
  and provide a set of recommendations for priority focus areas in the development
  of a national approach to integrated modelling. These recommendations draw on—and
  have broader relevance for—international efforts around integrated modelling to
  inform decision-making for marine systems.'
