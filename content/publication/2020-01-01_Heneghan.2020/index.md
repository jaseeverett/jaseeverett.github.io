abstract: Despite their critical role as the main energy pathway between phytoplankton
  and fish, the functional complexity of zooplankton is typically poorly resolved
  in marine ecosystem models. Trait-based approaches—where zooplankton are represented
  with functional traits such as body size—could help improve the resolution of zooplankton
  in marine ecosystem models and their role in trophic transfer and carbon sequestration.
  Here, we present the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra version 2 (ZooMSSv2), a functional
  size-spectrum model that resolves nine major zooplankton functional groups (heterotrophic
  flagellates, heterotrophic ciliates, larvaceans, omnivorous copepods, carnivorous
  copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, salps and jellyfish). Each group is represented
  by the functional traits of body size, size-based feeding characteristics and carbon
  content. The model is run globally at 5° resolution to steady-state using long-term
  average temperature and chlorophyll a for each grid-cell. Zooplankton community
  composition emerges based on the relative fitness of the different groups. Emergent
  steady-state patterns of global zooplankton abundance, biomass and growth rates
  agree well with empirical data, and the model is robust to changes in the boundary
  conditions of the zooplankton. We use the model to consider the role of the zooplankton
  groups in supporting higher trophic levels, by exploring the sensitivity of steady-state
  fish biomass to the removal of individual zooplankton groups across the global ocean.
  Our model shows zooplankton play a key role in supporting fish biomass in the global
  ocean. For example, the removal of euphausiids or omnivorous copepods caused fish
  biomass to decrease by up to 80\%. By contrast, the removal of carnivorous copepods
  caused fish biomass to increase by up to 75\%. Our results suggest that including
  zooplankton complexity in ecosystem models could be key to better understanding
  the distribution of fish biomass and trophic efficiency across the global ocean.
