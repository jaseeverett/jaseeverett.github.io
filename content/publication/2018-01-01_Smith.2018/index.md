abstract: Larval fishes are a useful metric of marine ecosystem state and change,
  as well as species-specific patterns in phenology. The high level of taxonomic expertise
  required to identify larval fishes to species level, and the considerable effort
  required to collect samples, make these data very valuable. Here we collate 3178
  samples of larval fish assemblages, from 12 research projects from 1983-present,
  from temperate and subtropical Australian pelagic waters. This forms a benchmark
  for the larval fish assemblage for the region, and includes recent monitoring of
  larval fishes at coastal oceanographic reference stations. Comparing larval fishes
  among projects can be problematic due to differences in taxonomic resolution, and
  identifying all taxa to species is challenging, so this study reports a standard
  taxonomic resolution (of 218 taxa) for this region to help guide future research.
  This larval fish database serves as a data repository for surveys of larval fish
  assemblages in the region, and can contribute to analysis of climate-driven changes
  in the location and timing of the spawning of marine fishes.
