abstract: Determining the magnitude of primary production (PP) in a changing ocean
  is a major research challenge. Thousands of estimates of marine PP exist globally,
  but there remain significant gaps in data availability, particularly in the Southern
  Hemisphere. In situ PP estimates are generally single-point measurements and therefore
  we rely on satellite models of PP in order to scale up over time and space. To reduce
  the uncertainty around the model output, these models need to be assessed against
  in situ measurements before use. This study examined the vertically-integrated productivity
  in four water-masses associated with the East Australian Current (EAC), the major
  western boundary current (WBC) of the South Pacific. We calculated vertically integrated
  PP from shipboard 14C PP estimates and then compared them to estimates from four
  commonly used satellite models (ESQRT, VGPM, VGPM-Eppley, VGPM-Kameda) to assess
  their utility for this region. Vertical profiles of the water-column show each water-mass
  had distinct temperature–salinity signatures. The depth of the fluorescence-maximum
  (fmax) increased from onshore (river plume) to offshore (EAC) as light penetration
  increased. Depth integrated PP was highest in river plumes (792±181mgCm−2d−1) followed
  by the EAC (534±116mgCm−2d−1), continental shelf (140±47mgCm−2d−1) and cyclonic
  eddy waters (121±4mgCm−2d−1). Surface carbon assimilation efficiency was greatest
  in the EAC (301±145mgC (mgChl-a)−1d−1) compared to other water masses. All satellite
  primary production models tested underestimated EAC PP and overestimated continental
  shelf PP. The ESQRT model had the highest skill and lowest bias of the tested models,
  providing the best first-order estimates of PP on the continental shelf, including
  at a coastal time-series station, Port Hacking, which showed considerable inter-annual
  variability (155–2957mgCm−2d−1). This work provides the first estimates of depth
  integrated PP associated with the East Australian Current in temperate Australia.
  The ongoing intensification of all WBCs makes it critical to understand the variability
  in PP at the regional scale. More accurate predictions in the EAC region will require
  vertically-resolved in situ productivity and bio-optical measurements across multiple
  time scales to allow development of other models which simulate dynamic ocean conditions.
