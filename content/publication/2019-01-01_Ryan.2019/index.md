abstract: Shark attacks are rare but traumatic events that generate social and economic
  costs and often lead to calls for enhanced attack mitigation strategies that are
  detrimental to sharks and other wildlife. Improved understanding of the influence
  of environmental conditions on shark attack risk may help to inform shark management
  strategies. Here, we developed predictive models for the risk of attack by white
  Carcharodon carcharias, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and bull/whaler Carcharhinus spp.
  sharks in Australian waters based on location â€¦
