Zooplankton biomass data have been collected in Australian waters since the 1930s, yet most datasets have been unavailable to the research community. We have collated >15,000 records of marine zooplankton biomass from Australian waters. Many of these are small-scale datasets, but when combined, they provide over 85 years of large-scale zooplankton community biomass data for Australian waters from 1932 to the present. 

Using generalised additive models (GAMs) based on a suite of environmental variables including sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and depth, we are producing spatial maps of zooplankton biomass in Australian waters.

The end goal is for these maps to be provided to the community as model-ready data products. The Australian Zooplankton Biomass Database and associated modelled-products will be invaluable for global change studies, research assessing trophic level linkages, and for initialising and assessing biogeochemical and ecosystem models of lower trophic levels.
