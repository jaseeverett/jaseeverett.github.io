We are generating maps of broad taxonomic groups of zooplankton (Copepods, Chaetognaths, Euphausiids, Larvaceans, Salps, Jellyfish). These empirical data will be used in conjucntion with a zooplankton-resolved size-spectra model in order to quantify the global energy transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to fish.
