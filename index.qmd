::: {#about-block}
:::

I am a biological oceanographer and data scientist. I work on understanding how oceanographic processes structure global pelagic food webs, designing climate-smart marine protected areas and investigating the impact of climate-change on marine ecosystem function. I enjoy working with model output, including oceanographic, climate and size-spectra, and collating large observational datasets to analyse.

Recently I have been building R-packages and R-shiny visualisation tools and applying novel spatial planning methods to inform marine spatial management. I am currently working on tools for on-the-ground deployment in the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) and various island nations of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.

Find out more about my [Research](research/index.qmd), and the [Tools](tools/index.qmd) we have released on these pages.

Currently, I'm a Senior Research Fellow in the Mathematical Marine Ecology Research Laboratory at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) and a Visiting Scientist at [The University of New South Wales](https:://www.bees.unsw.edu.au) and [CSIRO Environment](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/environment)
